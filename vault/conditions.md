# Diseases

## Frothjaw

The creature can't add its PB to attack rolls made with Martial Weapons, and any attacks it makes with Natural or Improvised Weapons deal an additional 1d4 points of damage. While it has fewer than 15 HP, the creature becomes suicidally hostile to each creature it can see.

## Redding Ague
A creature infected with Redding Ague does not recover stacks of [Exhaustion](conditions.md#exhaustion) upon completing a Long Rest.
Whenever an infected creature fails a CON Save by 5 or more, it acquires a stack of [Exhaustion](conditions.md#exhaustion).

## Sewer Plague
Any Humanoid that is wounded by a creature that carries the contagion or that comes into contact with contaminated filth or offal must succeed on a DC 11 CON Save or become infected with Sewer Plague. A creature suffers the following effects 1d4 days after infection:
- **Fatigue.** The creature gains 1 stack of [Exhaustion](conditions.md#exhaustion).
- **Weakness.** While the creature has any [Exhaustion](conditions.md#exhaustion), it regains only half the normal number of HP from spending HP Dice.
- **Restlessness.** While the creature has any [Exhaustion](conditions.md#exhaustion), finishing a Long Rest neither restores lost HP nor reduces the creature's Exhaustion.
- **Fighting the Contagion.** After a Long Rest, an infected creature makes a DC 11 CON Save. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 stack of [Exhaustion](conditions.md#exhaustion) as its fatigue worsens. On a successful save, the creature's [Exhaustion](conditions.md#exhaustion) decreases by 1. If the creature has no [Exhaustion](conditions.md#exhaustion), the contagion ends.

## Sight Rot
Any Beast or Humanoid that drinks water tainted by Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 CON Save or be [Blinded](conditions.md#blinded) until the contagion ends.
- **Fighting the Contagion.** Magic such as [Heal](spells.md#heal) or [Lesser Restoration](spells.md#lesser-restoration) end the contagion immediately. A character who is proficient with a [Herbalism Kit](dm/items.md#herbalism-kit) can use it to create one dose of nonmagical ointment, which takes 1 hour. When applied to the eyes of a creature suffering from Sight Rot, the ointment suppresses the contagion on that creature for 24 hours. If the contagion is suppressed in this way for a total of 72 hours (requiring three doses and applications of the ointment), the contagion ends.
- **Spreading the Contagion.** Any Humanoid that makes skin contact with a creature infected with Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 CON Save or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can't catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours.

## Cackle Fever
Any Humanoid (gnomes are immune). A creature suffers the following effects 1d4 days after infection:
- **Fever.** The creature gains 1 stack of [Exhaustion](conditions.md#exhaustion), which lasts until the contagion ends.
- **Uncontrollable Laughter.** While the creature has any [Exhaustion](conditions.md#exhaustion), it makes a DC 13 CON Save each time it takes damage other than Psychic damage. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) Psychic damage and becomes [Incapacitated](conditions.md#incapacitated) as it laughs uncontrollably. At the end of each of its turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.
- **Fighting the Contagion.** At the end of each Long Rest, an infected creature makes a DC 13 CON Save. After the creature succeeds on three of these saves, the contagion ends on it, and the creature is immune to Cackle Fever for 1 year.
- **Spreading the Contagion.** Any Humanoid (other than a gnome) that starts its turn within a radius 2 *(3m)* Emanation originating from a creature infected with Cackle Fever must succeed on a DC 10 CON Save or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can't catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours.
