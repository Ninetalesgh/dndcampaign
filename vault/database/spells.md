### Astral Maelstrom
*Level 5 Transmutation*
- **Casting Time**: Action
- **Range**: 12 *(18m)*
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: [Concentration](conditions.md#concentration), up to 1 minute
You create a radius 1 *(1.5m)* sphere disk of unimaginable density in an unoccupied space you can see within range; raw voidstuff compressed until it glows with a searing light that does not reflect or illuminate.
As a Bonus Action on each of your turns, you can cause each creature within 6 *(9m)* of the disk to make a STR Save. On a failure, a creature is dragged 2 *(3m)* toward the disk.

### Astral Projection
*Level 9 Necromancy*
- **Casting Time**: 1 Hr.
- **Range**: 2 *(3m)*
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Until dispelled
You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell ends instantly if you are already on that plane). Each target's body is left behind in a state of suspended animation; it is [Unconscious](conditions.md#unconscious), doesn't need food or air, and doesn't age.
A target's astral form resembles its body in almost every way, replicating its game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that trails from between the shoulder blades of the astral form. The cord fades from view after 30cm. If the cord is cut—which happens only when an effect states that it does so—the target's body and astral form both die.
A target's astral form can travel through the Astral Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that plane, the target's body and possessions travel along the silver cord, causing the target to re-enter its body on the new plane.
Any damage or other effects that apply to an astral form have no effect on the target's body and vice versa. If a target's body or astral form drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends for that target. The spell ends for all the targets if you take a Magic action to dismiss it.
When the spell ends for a target who isn't dead, the target reappears in its body and exits the state of suspended animation.

### Contingency
*Level 6 Abjuration*

- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 10 days
Choose a spell of level 5 or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of an action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting Contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain trigger occurs. You describe that trigger when you cast the two spells. For example, a Contingency cast with Water Breathing might stipulate that Water Breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.
The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the trigger occurs for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then Contingency ends.
The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one Contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another Contingency spell on you ends. Also, Contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.

Until the spell ends, you control any water inside an area you choose that is a Cube up to 20 *(30m)* on a side, using one of the following effects. As a Magic action on your later turns, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one. Flood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 4 *(6m)*. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a height 4 *(6m)* wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.
The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. Part Water. You part water in the area and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored. Redirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. Whirlpool. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must be at least 10 *(15m)* square and 5 *(7.5m)* deep. The whirlpool lasts until you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 1 *(1.5m)* wide at the base, up to 10 *(15m)* wide at the top, and 5 *(7.5m)* tall. Any creature in the water and within 5 *(7.5m)* of the whirlpool is pulled 2 *(3m)* toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a STR Save. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature can swim away from the whirlpool only if it first takes an action to pull away and succeeds on a STR (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.

When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the DM. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.
When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.

The effect lasts for the spell's duration, unless you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you've halted. Gusts. A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction you designate. You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that pass through it or that are made against targets within the cube have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, moving cost against the wind is doubled. Downdraft. You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a STR Save if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked [prone](conditions.md#prone). Updraft. You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube's bottom side. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 2 *(3m)* higher than normal.

### Create Undead
*Level 6 Necromancy*
- **Casting Time**: 1 Min.
- **Range**: 2 *(3m)*
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small Humanoids within range. Each one becomes a Ghoul under your control (see the Monster Manual for its stat block).
As a Bonus Action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 24 *(36m)* of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to them). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular place. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow the order until its task is complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell rather than animating new ones.
**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** If you use a level 7 spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four Ghouls. If you use a level 8 spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five Ghouls or two Ghasts or Wights. If you use a level 9 spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over six Ghouls, three Ghasts or Wights, or two Mummies. See the Monster Manual for these stat blocks.

When the spell ends, the magic animating them disappears, and the trees take root again if possible. Additional Spell Effect. You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area:A constant [Gust of Wind](spells.md#gust-of-wind) in two locations of your choiceSpike growth in one location of your choiceWind wall in two locations of your choiceTo a creature immune to this effect, the winds are a fragrant, gentle breeze, and the area of spike growth is harmless.

### Forbiddance
*Level 6 Abjuration (ritual)*

- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 day
You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 4000 m² of floor space to a height of 6 *(9m)* above the floor. For the duration, creatures can't teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the Gate spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, the Feywild, the Shadowfell, or the Plane Shift spell.
In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead. When a creature of a chosen type enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 Radiant or Necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).
You can designate a password when you cast the spell. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.
The spell's area can't overlap with the area of another Forbiddance spell. If you cast Forbiddance every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the Material components are consumed on the last casting.

An immobile, [Invisible](conditions.md#invisible), Cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.
A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 4 *(6m)* on a side and is made from 1.5cm diameter bars spaced 1.5cm apart. A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 2 *(3m)* on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.
When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside it, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside it.
A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave, it must first make a CHA  Save. On a successful save, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failed save, the creature doesn't exit the cage and wastes the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
This spell can't be dispelled by Dispel Magic.

### Glyph of Warding
*Level 3 Abjuration*
- **Casting Time**: 1 Hr.
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Until dispelled or triggered
You inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 2 *(3m)* in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 2 *(3m)* from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful WIS (Perception) check against your spell save DC to notice.
When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose whether it's an explosive rune or a spell glyph, as explained below. 
- **Set the Trigger.** You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
You can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. 
- **Explosive Rune**. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a radius 4 *(6m)* sphere centered on the glyph. Each creature in the area makes a DEX Save. A creature takes 5d8 Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your choice when you create the glyph) on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. 
- **Spell Glyph.** You can store a prepared spell of level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way.
When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell takes effect. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons Hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires Concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.
**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage of an explosive rune increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the spell slot you use for the Glyph of Warding.

You write on parchment, paper, or another suitable material and imbue it with an illusion that lasts for the duration. To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, seems to be written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, the illusion can alter the meaning, handwriting, and language of the text, though the language must be one you know.
If the spell is dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.
A creature that has Truesight can read the hidden message.

- **Casting Time**: Action
- **Range**: 18 *(27m)*
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: [Concentration](conditions.md#concentration), up to 1 minute
Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a DEX Save. It takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the spell's duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a radius 6 *(9m)* sphere and dim light for an additional 6 *(9m)*. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the Save. It takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one. These magical flames can't be extinguished by nonmagical means.

### Imprisonment
*Level 9 Abjuration*
- **Casting Time**: 1 Min.
- **Range**: 6 *(9m)*
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Until dispelled
You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a WIS Save. On a successful save, the target is unaffected, and it is immune to this spell for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the target is imprisoned. While imprisoned, the target doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the imprisoned target, and the target can't teleport.
Until the spell ends, the target is also affected by one of the following effects of your choice:
- *Burial.* The target is entombed beneath the earth in a hollow globe of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass into or out of the globe.
- *Chaining.* Chains firmly rooted in the ground hold the target in place. The target is [Restrained](conditions.md#restrained) and can't be moved by any means.
- *Hedged Prison.* The target is trapped in a demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane is your choice of a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or the like.
- *Minimus Containment.* The target becomes 3cm tall and is trapped inside an indestructible gemstone or a similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through by any means.
- *Slumber.* The target is [Unconscious](conditions.md#unconscious) and can't be awoken.
- *Ending the Spell.* When you cast the spell, specify a trigger that will end it. The trigger can be as simple or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that it has a high likelihood of happening within the next decade. The trigger must be an observable action, such as someone making a particular offering at the temple of your god, saving your true love, or defeating a specific monster.
A Dispel Magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast with a level 9 spell slot, targeting either the prison or the component used to create it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it makes a DEX Save, taking 10d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
The cloud moves 2 *(3m)* away from you in a direction you choose at the start of each of your turns.

Each target must succeed on a WIS Save or be [charmed](conditions.md#charmed) by you until the spell ends, or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. While [charmed](conditions.md#charmed) in this way, a creature can do nothing but use its movement to approach you in a safe manner. While an affected creature is within 1 *(1.5m)* of you, it cannot move, but simply stares greedily at the gem you present.
At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a WIS Save. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

### Infernal Calling
*Level 5 Conjuration*
- **Casting Time**: 1 Min.
- **Range**: 18 *(27m)*
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: [Concentration](conditions.md#concentration), up to 1 hour
Uttering a dark incantation, you summon a devil from the Nine Hells. You choose the devil's type, which must be one of challenge rating 6 or lower, such as a barbed devil or a bearded devil. The devil appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The devil disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The devil is unfriendly toward you and your companions. Roll initiative for the devil, which has its own turns. It is under the Dungeon Master's control and acts according to its nature on each of its turns, which might result in its attacking you if it thinks it can prevail, or trying to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange for limited service. The DM has the creature's statistics.
On each of your turns, you can try to issue a verbal command to the devil (no action required by you). It obeys the command if the likely outcome is in accordance with its desires, especially if the result would draw you toward evil. Otherwise, you must make a CHA  (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check contested by its WIS (Insight) check. You make the check with advantage if you say the devil's true name. If your check fails, the devil becomes immune to your verbal commands for the duration of the spell, though it can still carry out your commands if it chooses. If your check succeeds, the devil carries out your command—such as ""attack my enemies,"" ""explore the room ahead,"" or ""bear this message to the queen""—until it completes the activity, at which point it returns to you to report having done so.
If your concentration ends before the spell reaches its full duration, the devil doesn't disappear if it has become immune to your verbal commands. Instead, it acts in whatever manner it chooses for 3d6 minutes, and then it disappears.
If you possess an individual devil's talisman, you can summon that devil if it is of the appropriate challenge rating plus 1, and it obeys all your commands, with no CHA  checks required.
**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.

Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell's Material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container's space. You can't move or take Reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 20 *(30m)* out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a Humanoid's body.
You can attempt to possess any Humanoid within 20 *(30m)* of you that you can see (creatures warded by a Protection from Evil and Good or Magic Circle spell can't be possessed). The target makes a CHA  Save. On a failed save, your soul enters the target's body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the container. On a successful save, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.
Once you possess a creature's body, you control it. Your Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, STR, DEX, CON, Speed, and senses are replaced by the creature's. You otherwise keep your game statistics.
Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can't move and it is [Incapacitated](conditions.md#incapacitated).

Otherwise, you die.
If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul returns to your body. If your body is more than 20 *(30m)* away from you or if your body is dead, you die. If another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 20 *(30m)*. Otherwise, that creature dies.
When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart strikes a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 Force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

### Magic Mouth
*Level 2 Illusion (ritual)*
- **Casting Time**: 1 Min. or Ritual
- **Range**: 6 *(9m)*
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Until dispelled
You implant a message within an object in range—a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or fewer, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.
When that trigger occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there, so the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.
The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 6 *(9m)* of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 6 *(9m)* of the object or when a silver bell rings within 6 *(9m)* of it.

### Magic Stone
*Transmutation Cantrip*
- **Casting Time**: Bonus Action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 minute
You touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, a pebble has a range of 12 *(18m)*. If someone else attacks with a pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attacker's, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Whether the attack hits or misses, the spell then ends on the stone.
If you cast this spell again, the spell ends on any pebbles still affected by your previous casting.

### Magic Weapon
*Level 2 Transmutation*
- **Casting Time**: Bonus Action

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The bonus increases to +2 with a level 3-5 spell slot. The bonus increases to +3 with a level 6+ spell slot.

### Magnify Gravity
*Level 1 Transmutation*
- **Casting Time**: Action
- **Range**: 12 *(18m)*
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 round
The gravity in a radius 2 *(3m)* sphere centered on a point you can see within range increases for a moment. Each creature in the sphere on the turn when you cast the spell must make a CON Save. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 force damage, and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no reduction to its speed.
Until the start of your next turn, any object that isn't being worn or carried in the sphere requires a successful Strength check against your spell save DC to pick up or move.
**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
- **Classes**: Wizard

### Major Image
*Level 3 Illusion*
- **Casting Time**: Action
- **Range**: 24 *(36m)*
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: [Concentration](conditions.md#concentration), up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a size 4 *(6m)* cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted, but it can't deal damage or cause conditions.
If you are within range of the illusion, you can take a Magic action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, for things can pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful INT (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.
**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring Concentration, if cast with a level 4+ spell slot.

- **Casting Time**: Action

You attempt to bleed away a creature's reserves of magic, forcing it to make a CHA  Save. On a failure, the target must expend one spell level worth of spell slots for each point it failed by.
A creature that can't do so loses no spell slots on a failed Save, and is instead [Dazed](conditions.md#dazed) until the end of its next turn on a failure.
Design Note: Spellcasters Without Spell Slots. At DM discretion, a spellcasting monster that does not use spell slots affected by this ability may suffer some other effect, such as temporarily losing the ability to cast its most powerful spell, or having one or more uses of a limited magical ability depleted.

The escape DC for this restraint is equal to your spell save DC.

*Level 9 Transmutation*
- **Casting Time**: Action
- **Range**: 24 *(36m)*
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: [Concentration](conditions.md#concentration), up to 1 hour
You transform up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target must succeed on a WIS Save to resist the transformation. An unwilling shapechanger automatically succeeds on the save.
Each target assumes a beast form of your choice, and you can choose the same form or different ones for each target. The new form can be any beast you have seen whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or half the target's level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, but the target retains its hit points, alignment, and personality.
Each target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the hit points of its new form. These temporary hit points can't be replaced by temporary hit points from another source. A target reverts to its normal form when it has no more temporary hit points or it dies. If the spell ends before then, the creature loses all its temporary hit points and reverts to its normal form.
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form. It can't speak, cast spells, or do anything else that requires hands or speech.
The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: 24 hours
You suggest a course of activity—described in no more than 25 words—to twelve or fewer creatures you can see within range that can hear and understand you. The suggestion must sound achievable and not involve anything that would obviously deal damage to any of the targets or their allies. For example, you could say, ""Walk to the village down that road, and help the villagers there harvest crops until sunset.
"" Or you could say, ""Now is not the time for violence. Drop your weapons, and dance! Stop in an hour.
""Each target must succeed on a WIS Save or be [Charmed](conditions.md#charmed) for the duration or until you or your allies deal damage to the target. Each [Charmed](conditions.md#charmed) target pursues the suggestion to the best of its ability. The suggested activity can continue for the entire duration, but if the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends for a target upon completing it.
**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The duration is longer with a spell slot of level 7 (10 days), 8 (30 days), or 9 (366 days).

- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: [Concentration](conditions.md#concentration), up to 1 minute
You choose a size 1 *(1.5m)* square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 1 *(1.5m)* of it. The target must make a STR Save. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is [restrained](conditions.md#restrained) for the spell's duration.
As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the [restrained](conditions.md#restrained) target, which must make a STR Save. The target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
To break out, the [restrained](conditions.md#restrained) target can use its action to make a STR check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer [restrained](conditions.md#restrained) by the hand.
As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a [restrained](conditions.md#restrained) target if you do either.

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

### Meld into Stone
*Level 3 Transmutation (ritual)*
- **Casting Time**: Action or Ritual
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 8 hours
You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, merging yourself and your equipment with the stone for the duration. You must touch the stone to do so. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.
While merged with the stone, you can't see what occurs outside it, and any WIS (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with Disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use 1 *(1.5m)* of movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can't move.
Minor physical damage to the stone doesn't harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 Force damage to you. The stone's complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 Force damage to you. If expelled, you move into an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered and be [Prone](conditions.md#prone).

You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration. When you cast the spell—and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter—you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 24 *(36m)* of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 1 *(1.5m)* of the point where the meteor explodes must make a DEX Save. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

On a failed save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and you make the area immediately around the target's space appear dangerous to it in some way. You might cause the target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws filled with dripping teeth. Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can't see or hear anything beyond it and is [restrained](conditions.md#restrained) for the spell's duration.

### Mighty Fortress
*Level 8 Conjuration*
- **Casting Time**: 1 Min.
- **Range**: 1 mile
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
A fortress of stone erupts from a square area of ground of your choice that you can see within range. The area is 24 *(36m)* on each side, and it must not have any buildings or other structures on it. Any creatures in the area are harmlessly lifted up as the fortress rises.
The fortress has four turrets with square bases, each one 4 *(6m)* on a side and 6 *(9m)* tall, with one turret on each corner. The turrets are connected to each other by stone walls that are each 16 *(24m)* long, creating an enclosed area. Each wall is 30cm thick and is composed of panels that are 2 *(3m)* wide and 4 *(6m)* tall. Each panel is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel and a turret. You can place up to four stone doors in the fortress's outer wall.
A small keep stands inside the enclosed area. The keep has a square base that is 10 *(15m)* on each side, and it has three floors with height 2 *(3m)* ceilings. Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 1 *(1.5m)* on each side. The floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its walls are 15cm thick, and interior rooms can have stone doors or open archways as you choose. The keep is furnished and decorated however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people each day. Furnishings, food, and other objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed from the fortress.
A staff of one hundred [invisible](conditions.md#invisible) servants obeys any command given to them by creatures you designate when you cast the spell. Each servant functions as if created by the unseen servant spell.
The walls, turrets, and keep are all made of stone that can be damaged. Each 2-by-2 *(3m-by-3m)* section of stone has AC 15 and 30 HP per 2.5cm of thickness. It is immune to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a section of stone to 0 HP destroys it and might cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the DM's discretion.
After 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere else, the fortress harmlessly crumbles and sinks back into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it safely on the ground.
Casting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days for a year makes the fortress permanent.

On a failed save, you also always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can't become hidden from you, and if it is [Invisible](conditions.md#invisible), it gains no benefit from that condition against you.
**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.

A creature making multiple attempts to read your mind encounters the same result; it can't repeat this Save until you cast the spell again.
This spell does not allow you to detect when creatures are attempting to read your mind.

*Illusion Cantrip*
- **Casting Time**: Action
- **Range**: 6 *(9m)*
- **Components**: S
- **Duration**: 1 minute
You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. See the descriptions below for the effects of each. The illusion ends if you cast this spell again.
If a creature takes a Study action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful INT (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature. Sound. If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends. Image. If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a size 1 *(1.5m)* cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it.

### Mirage Arcane
*Level 7 Illusion*
- **Casting Time**: 10 Min.
- **Range**: Sight
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 10 days
You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other rough or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.
Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into Difficult Terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately.
Creatures with Truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

If any of the d6s rolls a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is hit instead of you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates otherwise ignore all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it is [Blinded](conditions.md#blinded), Blindsight, or Truesight.

### Modify Memory
*Level 5 Enchantment*
- **Casting Time**: Action
- **Range**: 6 *(9m)*
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: [Concentration](conditions.md#concentration), up to 1 minute
You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that you can see within range makes a WIS Save. If you are fighting the creature, it has Advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target is [Charmed](conditions.md#charmed) for the duration. While [Charmed](conditions.md#charmed) in this way, the target also is [Incapacitated](conditions.md#incapacitated) and is unaware of its surroundings, though it can hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and no memories are modified.
While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity, change its memory of the event's details, or create a memory of some other event.
You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you finish describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.
A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as a false memory of how much the creature enjoyed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature.
A Remove Curse or Greater Restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.
**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (level 6 spell slot), 30 days ago (level 7 spell slot), 365 days ago (level 8 spell slot), or any time in the creature's past (level 9 spell slot).

You manipulate it in one of the following ways:If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 1 *(1.5m)* away. This movement doesn't involve enough force to cause damage.
You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.
If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a CON Save.

On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell's area moves into its space and when it enters the spell's area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.
Payment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.
A task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 GP per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 GP per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.
After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.

### Planar Binding
*Level 5 Abjuration*
- **Casting Time**: 1 Hr.
- **Range**: 12 *(18m)*
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 24 hours
You attempt to bind a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of the inverted version of the Magic Circle spell to trap it while this spell is cast.
) At the completion of the casting, the target must succeed on a CHA  Save or be bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.
A bound creature must follow your commands to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. If the creature is Hostile, it strives to twist your commands to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your commands completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.
**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The duration increases with a spell slot of level 6 (10 days), 7 (30 days), 8 (180 days), and 9 (366 days).

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.

The wall sheds Bright Light within 20 *(30m)* and Dim Light for an additional 20 *(30m)*. You and creatures you designate when you cast the spell can pass through and be near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves within 4 *(6m)* of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a CON Save or be [Blinded](conditions.md#blinded) for 1 minute.
The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature reaches into or passes through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the layers. Each layer forces the creature to make a DEX Save or be affected by that layer's properties as described in the Prismatic Layers table.
The wall, which has AC 10, can be destroyed one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. If a layer is destroyed, it is gone for the duration. Antimagic Field has no effect on the wall, and Dispel Magic can affect only the violet layer.

6Indigo. Failed Save: The target is [Restrained](conditions.md#restrained) and makes a CON Save at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it is [Petrified](conditions.md#petrified) until it is freed by an effect like the Greater Restoration spell. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. Additional Effects: Spells can't be cast through this layer, which is destroyed by Bright Light shed by the Daylight spell.
7Violet. Failed Save: The target is [Blinded](conditions.md#blinded) and makes a WIS Save at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another plane of existence (DM's choice). Additional Effects: This layer is destroyed by Dispel Magic.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to hurl fire at a creature or an object within 12 *(18m)* of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Fire damage.

### Programmed Illusion
*Level 6 Illusion*
- **Casting Time**: Action
- **Range**: 24 *(36m)*
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Until dispelled
You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific trigger occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a size 6 *(9m)* cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.
When the trigger you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes, after which the illusion can be activated again.
The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible phenomena that occur within 6 *(9m)* of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be illusory, since things can pass through it. A creature that takes the Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful INT (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

You can see through the illusion's eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. As a Magic action, you can move it up to 12 *(18m)* and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

Your skin can take any actions you could normally take in your own body (such as to fight or cast spells).

### Symbol
*Level 7 Abjuration*
- **Casting Time**: 1 Min.
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Until dispelled or triggered
You inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or chest). The glyph can cover an area no larger than 2 *(3m)* in diameter. If you choose an object, it must remain in place; if it is moved more than 2 *(3m)* from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful WIS (Perception) check against your spell save DC to notice.
When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose which effect the symbol bears: Death, Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning. Each one is explained below. Set the Trigger. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph.
You can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.
Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a radius 12 *(18m)* sphere with Dim Light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the Sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the Sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature is targeted only once per turn. Death. Each target makes a CON Save, taking 10d10 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful save. Discord. Each target makes a WIS Save. On a failed save, a target argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Fear. Each target must succeed on a WIS Save or be [Frightened](conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. While [Frightened](conditions.md#frightened), the target must move at least 6 *(9m)* away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able. Pain. Each target must succeed on a CON Save or be [Incapacitated](conditions.md#incapacitated) for 1 minute. Sleep. Each target must succeed on a WIS Save or be [Unconscious](conditions.md#unconscious) for 10 minutes. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone takes an action to shake it awake. Stunning. Each target must succeed on a WIS Save or be [Stunned](conditions.md#stunned) for 1 minute.

On a failed save, a target also has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it subtracts 1d6 from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as any CON Saves to maintain Concentration. The target makes an INT Save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Similar Area. You and your group (or the target object) appear in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. You appear in the closest similar place.

### Teleportation Circle
*Level 5 Conjuration*
- **Casting Time**: 1 Min.
- **Range**: 2 *(3m)*
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: 1 round
As you cast the spell, you draw a radius 1 *(1.5m)* circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 1 *(1.5m)* of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
Many major temples, guildhalls, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles. Each circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of runes arranged in a particular pattern.
When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM. You might learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.
You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for 365 days.

### Temple of the Gods
*Level 7 Conjuration*

You cause a temple to shimmer into existence on ground you can see within range. The temple must fit within an unoccupied cube of space, up to 24 *(36m)* on each side. The temple remains until the spell ends. It is dedicated to whatever god, pantheon, or philosophy is represented by the holy symbol used in the casting.
You make all decisions about the temple's appearance. The interior is enclosed by a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting access to the interior and as many windows as you wish. Only you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the door.
The temple's interior is an open space with an idol or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light. The smell of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.
The temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a CHA  Save. On a failed save, it can't enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a Save inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.
In addition, the sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the temple, and creatures within can't be targeted by divination spells.
Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your WIS modifier (minimum 1 hit point).
The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple's interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple's exterior. It can't be dispelled by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it. A disintegrate spell destroys the temple instantly.
Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

The disk remains for the duration and can hold up to 250kg. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.
The disk is immobile while you are within 4 *(6m)* of it. If you move more than 4 *(6m)* away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 4 *(6m)* of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 2 *(3m)* or more. For example, the disk can't move across a depth 2 *(3m)* pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.
If you move more than 20 *(30m)* from the disk (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 Hit Points per size 2 *(3m)* section, and it has Immunity to Cold, Poison, and Psychic damage and Vulnerability to Fire damage. Reducing a size 2 *(3m)* section of wall to 0 Hit Points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.

*Level 5 Evocation*
- **Casting Time**: Action
- **Range**: 24 *(36m)*
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: [Concentration](conditions.md#concentration), up to 10 minutes
A shimmering wall of bright light appears at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can be free floating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 12 *(18m)* long, 2 *(3m)* high, and 1 *(1.5m)* thick. The wall blocks line of sight, but creatures and objects can pass through it. It emits bright light out to 24 *(36m)* and dim light for an additional 24 *(36m)*.
When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a CON Save. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is [blinded](conditions.md#blinded) for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [blinded](conditions.md#blinded). A [blinded](conditions.md#blinded) creature can make a CON Save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
A creature that ends its turn in the wall's area takes 4d8 radiant damage.
Until the spell ends, you can use an action to launch a beam of radiance from the wall at one creature you can see within 12 *(18m)* of it. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, reduce the length of the wall by 2 *(3m)*. If the wall's length drops to 0 *(0m)*, the spell ends.
**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

### Wall of Stone
*Level 5 Evocation*
- **Casting Time**: Action
- **Range**: 24 *(36m)*
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: [Concentration](conditions.md#concentration), up to 10 minutes
A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 15cm thick and is composed of ten 3-by-3 meters panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. Alternatively, you can create 3-by-6 meters panels that are only 8cm thick.
If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a DEX Save. On a success, it can use its Reaction to move up to its Speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.
The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on a firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.
If you create a span greater than 4 *(6m)* in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create battlements and the like.
The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 Hit Points per 2.5cm of thickness, and it has Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. Reducing a panel to 0 Hit Points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.
If you maintain your Concentration on this spell for its full duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

- **Range**: 24 *(36m)*
- **Components**: V, S

You create a wall of tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 12 *(18m)* long, 2 *(3m)* high, and 1 *(1.5m)* thick or a circle that has a diameter 4 *(6m)* and is up to 4 *(6m)* high and 1 *(1.5m)* thick. The wall blocks line of sight.
When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a DEX Save, taking 7d8 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 30cm a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 0.
8 *(1.
2000000000000002m)* of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters a space in the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature makes a DEX Save, taking 7d8 Slashing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

You create a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 6 *(9m)* long, 2 *(3m)* high, and 30cm thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 4 *(6m)* in diameter, 4 *(6m)* high, and 30cm thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall's space is difficult terrain.
Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a size 1 *(1.5m)* square section is frozen). Eacha size 1 *(1.5m)* square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall's water doesn't fill it.

The wind has the following effects:It deafens you and other creatures in its area.
It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.
It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.
The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.

*Level 4 Conjuration*
- **Casting Time**: Action
- **Range**: 18 *(27m)*
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: [Concentration](conditions.md#concentration), up to 1 minute
You conjure up a sphere of water with a radius 1 *(1.5m)* sphere at a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover but no more than 2 *(3m)* off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell's duration.
Any creature in the sphere's space must make a STR Save. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space of the creature's choice outside the sphere. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the Save automatically, and a Large or smaller creature can choose to fail it. On a failed save, a creature is [restrained](conditions.md#restrained) by the sphere and is engulfed by the water. At the end of each of its turns, a [restrained](conditions.md#restrained) target can repeat the Save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
The sphere can restrain as many as four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature that causes it to exceed this capacity, a random creature that was already [restrained](conditions.md#restrained) by the sphere falls out of it and lands [prone](conditions.md#prone) in a space within 1 *(1.5m)* of it.
As an action, you can move the sphere up to 6 *(9m)* in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, a cliff, or other drop-off, it safely descends until it is hovering 2 *(3m)* above the ground. Any creature [restrained](conditions.md#restrained) by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the Save.
When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 6 *(9m)* of it. Any creature [restrained](conditions.md#restrained) by the sphere is knocked [prone](conditions.md#prone) in the space where it falls. The water then vanishes.

You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The webs fill a size 4 *(6m)* cube there for the duration. The webs are Difficult Terrain, and the area within them is Lightly Obscured.
If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 1 *(1.5m)*.
The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DEX Save or be [Restrained](conditions.md#restrained) while in the webs or until it breaks free.
A creature [Restrained](conditions.md#restrained) by the webs can take an action to make a STR (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer [Restrained](conditions.md#restrained).

### Wish
*Level 9 Conjuration*
- **Casting Time**: Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.
The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.
Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:Object Creation. You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 60 *(90m)* in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.
Instant Health. You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the Greater Restoration spell.
Resistance. You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.
Spell Immunity. You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.
Sudden Learning. You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.
Roll Redo. You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a Wish spell could undo an ally's failed Save or a foe's Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.
Reshape Reality. You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.
The stress of casting Wish to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your STR score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again if you suffer this stress.
