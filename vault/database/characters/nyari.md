I can cast [Purify Food and Drink](spells.md#purify-food-and-drink) at will.

This is another test string [Detect Poison and Disease](spells.md#detect-poison-and-disease) or [Smite of Autumn](spells.md#paladin#level-1#smite-of-autumn)
- this is a link in a dumb spot **[Smite of Winter](spells.md#smite-of-winter)**.
