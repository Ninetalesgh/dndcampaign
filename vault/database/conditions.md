#### Bleeding 
  A Bleeding creature loses the specified amount of hit points at the beginning of each of its turns, i.e a creature that is "Bleeding (1d4)" loses 1d4 hit points at the beginning of each of its turns.
      Hit point loss represents loss of vital fluids, and is distinct from damage. Unless otherwise specified, it can't be resisted or reduced in any way. It has no effect on creatures with 0 hit points.
      Creatures that do not have blood or some equivalent vital fluid are immune to any effect that directly causes Hit Point Loss.
  If a creature that is already Bleeding would suffer a wound from a different source, the wound with the higher Hit Point Loss value overrides that with the lesser value.
      Rarely, some effects may cause a creature to accrue multiple instances of the Bleeding condition, and will specify if this is the case. Stacking wounds of the same value count as a single instance of the Bleeding condition with a Hit Point Loss value equal to their total cumulative Hit Point Loss value.
  The Bleeding condition ends for a creature that regains any hit points.
  Additionally, as an action, a creature may attempt a DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check to stanch the wounds of a Bleeding creature, ending the effect on a success.

  Automatically fail ability checks that require sight.
  Attack rolls against you have Advantage, your attack rolls have disadvantage.
#### Burning
  A Burning creature is on fire, and takes the specified amount of fire damage at the beginning of each of its turns, i.e. "Burning (1d10)."
  If a creature that is already Burning would gain the Burning condition from another source, the condition with the higher Burning value overrides that with the lesser value.
  The creature or a creature that can reach it may smother the flames as an action, ending the Burning condition for that creature. A Burning creature that is doused in water, that takes any cold damage, or that is in an airless environment, such as a bag of holding, has the condition immediately end for it.
