## Game Mechanics

### Basics

  Ability Scores | Description | Examples | Saving Throws
  :-- | :-- | :-- | :--
  Strength (STR) | Physical might | Lift, push, pull, or break something | Physically resist direct force
  Dexterity (DEX) | Agility, reflexes, and balance | Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly | Dodge out of harm's way 
  Costitution (CON) | Health and stamina | Push your body beyond normal limits | Endure a toxic hazard
  Intelligence (INT) | Reasoning and memory | Reason or remember | Recognize an illusion as fake
  Wisdom (WIS) | Perceptiveness and mental fortitude | Notice things in the environment or in creatures' behaviour | Resist a mental assault           
  Charisma (CHA) | Confidence, poise, and charm | Influence, entertain, or deceive | Assert your identity

  >[!INFO] Whenever Abilities are mentioned in game we refer to the Modifier, not the score itself! The Modifier is always $(AbilityScore-10)/2$ rounded down. For example, an Ability Score of 8 or 9 would result in -1, whereas an Ability Score of 14 or 15 would result in +2.  

- **Proficiency** -> +2 on all tests you are proficient in, this will increase after level 4. This bonus does not stack, multiple proficiencies in the same skill don't give you +4, etc.  
- **Three Types of d20 Tests** -> Attack Roll, Ability Check, Saving Throw 
  - ***Attack*** -> STR for melee, DEX for ranged, Varies for Spell Attack. Add your Proficiency Bonus if it's with a weapon you're proficient with or always add it if it's a Spell Attack. 
  - ***Ability Check*** -> Either roll on an Ability directly or on a Skill (Athletics, Acrobatics, etc.). Add your Proficiency Bonus to Ability Checks you are proficient in. 
    - ***Tools*** -> Proficiency stacks with Skills when Tools are used, if you have Proficiency in both the Skill and the Tool for an associated check you roll with Advantage.
  - ***Saving Throw*** -> Add your Proficiency Bonus if you're proficient in the Saving Throw of the Ability in question. I'll shorthand this to "Saves" in most places.
- **Advantage & Disadvantage** -> Roll twice on d20 tests, with Advantage you take the higher roll of the two, with Disadvantage you take the lower.
- **Difficulty Class (DC)** -> Very easy 5, easy 10, medium 15, hard 20, Very hard 25, nearly impossible 30 
- **Armor Class (AC)** -> Your Base AC + DEX. You can only have one Base AC, by default that is 10.
- **Health Points (HP)** -> Your Health, when it drops to 0 you are on the brink of death! You can never have more HP than your HP maximum.
- **Temporary HP (THP)** -> Extra health that allows you to go above your HP max, usually from some invigorating or morale boosting effect. You can only ever have one THP pool and they don't stack (for example, if you have 6 THP and would gain 10 THP from some effect, your THP becomes the higher one, in this case 10). 
- **Death Saves & Death** ->

### Turn Based Play
While we're not playing Turn Based do what you want, ask the GM anything, role play ahead!
We play Turn Based in dangerous time sensitive situations like Combat. When we do, we use Initiative.

  - Each **Round** of Initiative lets everyone (Players, NPCs and Monsters) take their turn once! Each Round takes roughly 6 seconds, which makes 1 minute = 10 Rounds. 
  - We use a custom distance unit in game, it's just a unitless value and 1 unit equals $2/3m$ in the fantasy world. I'll always have both this unit and meters listed in rules. On table play one Inch (or one square on miniature terrain with a grid) equals 1 unit. When looking up online content which is displayed in *feet*, divide that value by 5 to get to our unitless value (for example 30 feet = 6).

>[!INFO] Turn Based Overview - The Round
  Each Round is rougly 6 seconds.
  During each round everyone gets 1 Turn.


>[!INFO] Turn Based Overview - What you can do
  Move!
  1 Action (A) -> Your main thing!
  1 Bonus Action (BA) -> Hastily drink a potion? Also some Spells or Feats are Bonus Actions. 
  1 Reaction (R) -> Opportunity Attack? Also some Spells or Feats are Reactions.
  1 Free Action -> Something very minor, like open a door or push a button.
  Shout something!

  - **Movement**: Move - up to a range equal to your Speed. You can do this in parts (for example, move 1, use Action, move 4, use Bonus Action, move 1). ON GRIDS ONLY: Diagonal movement costs $3/2$, rounding down the total (so 2 full diagonal "steps" cost 3) 
  - **Actions**:
    - ***Attack*** -> Melee, Ranged, Spell.
      - *Melee Attack* -> Attack something in range, unless otherwise specified, your Melee Attack range is 1 (so you can attack things directly next to you).
      - *Ranged Attack* -> Attack something in range of your Ranged Attack. If the target is within range 1 or above normal range, you attack with Disadvantage.
      - *Spell Attack* -> Attack something in range of your Spell Attack. If the target is within range 1 you attack with Disadvantage.
    - ***Dash*** -> Double your Movement Speed for this turn.
    - ***Disengage*** -> Your movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of the turn.
    - ***Dodge*** -> Until the start of your next turn, attacks against you have Disadvantage and you get Advantage on DEX Saves.
    - ***Hide*** -> Make a DEX (Stealth) Check to attempt to hide!
    - ***Magic*** -> Cast a Spell or use a Magical Feature that needs your Action, or use a Magic Item.
    - ***Ready*** -> Prepare to take your Action outside of your turn in response to a trigger you define (for example "I hide behind the door and will attack the first enemy that runs in").
    - ***Influence / Search / Study / Utilize / Stabilize*** -> Do something in the heat of the moment, whatever you try might be accomplished right away or at least get you on the right track!
      - Influence a creature, like talk them down, distract them, or alter their attitude some other way. (Usually CHA)
      - Try to find something, like the source of some poison gas, the hidden switch on the wall to open the secret door, etc. (Usually WIS)
      - Study something, like a spell that an evildoer cast, find out where interleaved mechanical switches lead to understand what would happen if you flipped some switch, or how tree roots are growing towards a source of some energy. (Usually INT)
      - Versatile -> Use, or do something with, some object, whatever it might be.
      - Attempt to stabilize another character on the brink of death, at 0 HP, with a WIS (Medicine) Check. 
    - ***Help*** -> Help someone elses Ability Check or Attack Roll, giving them Advantage. 
    - **Drink Potion** -> Drink carefully, regenerate the maximum rollable result.
  - **Bonus Actions**:
    - **Drink Potion** -> Drink fast! Roll dice! Spill some! 
  - **Reaction**:
    - **Opportunity Attack** ->
