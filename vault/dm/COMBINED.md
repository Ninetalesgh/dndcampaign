# Backstory
#### Beginning ~ 600 DR
  First Settling by humans and dwarves in the Stormhorns between Tyrluk and High Horn establishing Elvine's Crossing north of the river 
    and the mining settlement Mithdral south of the river.
  the humans of Elvine's Crossing and the dwarves of Mithdral are flourishing in harmony with trade and craft.
  Both young settlements, they are ruled by houses Elster and Vinea above ground, and house Ironwhisper below.
  In reality the two human houses are one town council, with the men being called "Elster" and the women being called "Vinea".
  There always are to be 11 Elsters and 11 Vineas, all relevant town decisions are made by this council.
  Whenever a child of an Elster or Vinea turns 17 years old and there are fewer than 11 Elsters or Vineas, they get named accordingly and join the council.
  Or they can choose which name they want, if they are what's called "Feathered Vine", deemed to be the wisest leaders. (such as Lior Vinea)
  House Elster traditionally are Merchants and Diplomats and House Vinea traditionally are Engineers and Scholars, there are exceptions though.
#### Fall of Myth Drannor ~ 714 DR
  Elven refugees find refuge in the town of Elvine's Crossing and are welcomed.
  the elves decided to magically seal their own arcane powers because they were corrupted by Mythal.
  They establish a new life and prosper together with humans and dwarves.
#### The Frozen Depths ~ 848 DR
  the dwarves unknowingly dig into the lair of dragon Glacirax. 
  the conflict with the dragon and his hatchlings slowly escalates over the coming 10 years.  
#### Mithdral's Destruction and the Death of Glacirax ~ 859 DR
  The dragon had enough of the disturbances and wreaks havoc underground.
  The elves weren't able to bear losing another home and decide to unlock 
    their corrupted arcane power and channel it into what is thereafter referred to The Blood Curse.
  The elves share details of the curse with Tazlyn Stonewright to build a containment for their afterlife.
  Their cursed souls start to fester and they perish soon after.  
  Mithdral is in ruins, most dwarves frozen to death and practically all that survived moved to find refuge somewhere else.
#### Birth of Balin Stonewright ~ 860 DR
  Named after his father Balin Ironfoot, he later decided to adopt his 
    mother's name Stonewright out of respect for her work and the name recognition in his profession.
#### Construction of the Crypt ~ 862 DR
  Elvine's Crossing is renamed to Arvandral to honor the dwarves and the elves who will now rest here forever 
  the name is derived from Mithdral, the dwarven home, and Arvandor, 
    the outer plane elvish souls would go in the afterlife. (if they hadn't been corrupted by The Blood Curse)   
  Tazlyn Stonewright constructs the crypt with the main purpose being the containment of The Blood Curse, 
    but since it's being financed by the Two Houses they decided to also add rooms for them. 
#### Construction of the Mountain Pass begins, connecting Tyrluk and High Horn ~ 875 DR
  Through the initiative of Lior Vinea the project commences 
    with Tazlyn Stonewright in charge of the construction. 
  Lior Vinea being the key negotiator in establishing funding, 
    since the Two Houses alone wouldn't be able to fund this. 
#### Selera Vinea turns 17 ~ 893 DR
  She becomes a member of the house and accompanies Tazlyn during construction and becomes her student.
  Attempting to channel her affinity for magic through wondrous engineering.
#### Construction of the Mountain Pass finishes, connecting Tyrluk and High Horn ~ 899 DR
  Arvandral now is now situated in a promising position to flourish on trade.
#### Construction of the Estates ~ 910 DR
  As her final work Tazlyn Stonewright oversees construction of the two estates,
  one for House Elster, one for House Vinea. 
  Selera being an experienced engineer herself builds lots of secrets to the houses, especially the basements.
#### Selera Vinea begins to study necromancy in her new isolated estate basement ~ 911 DR
  Selera's unstoppable hunger for knowledge leads her to necromancy, 
  searching, among other things, for a way to permanently cleanse The Blood Curse from the elven souls.
  Tazlyn disapproves of her ambition, but stays quiet about it to anyone but her. 
#### Death of Tazlyn Stonewright ~ 930 DR
  Without Tazlyn holding Selera back, she now is beginning to test her 
    powers and extends her experiments with corpses and constructs, 
    digging deeper into the caverns below the estate basement and starting to abduct citizens for experiments.
  Tazlyn's sarcophagus gets placed in the Crypt's South Antechamber.
#### The Rise of the Undead ~ 932 DR 
Because of Selera's experiments undead begin to pop up around Arvandral, there are accidents, some people die.
  the captain of the guard, Halric Varron, who is investigating the aductions and undead activity is beginning 
    to suspect Selera.
#### Death of Lior Vinea ~ 933 DR
  Lior Vinea's sacrophagus gets placed in the Crypt's South Antechamber.
#### Death of Captain Halric Varron ~ 935 DR
  Halric put his nose where it doesn't belong, Selera kills him.
  Halric's sarcophagus gets placed in the Crypt's South Antechamber.  

#### The Collapse ~ 935 DR when the day was shortest
  2 months after Halric's death The Selera Ritual causes The Collapse, 
  swallowing huge parts of Arvandral whole, while the Vinea estate crumbles and slides down, 
  colliding with the Crypt's corridors.
  the grounds around The Blue Estate rise up, breaking the old bridge across the river.
  the entirety of House Vinea perish, House Elster loses all but 4 members.
  The Crypt becomes inaccessible.
  The Old Road east collapses and inaccessible, a new way across the river and around has to be found.
  the surviving membser of House Elster are:
    Zephyr Elster
    Evander Elster
    Theren Elster
    Fenric Elster
  The Council begins efforts to retell the history of House Elster and House Vinea, 
  They decide to not introduce any new members to The Council and initiate a yearly remembrance day to remember "the noble House Vinea", 
    every year at sundawn of the shortest day.
  The Ruins are explored briefly but considered a lost cause and become a place to respect the dead and remember The Collapse.
  In the years after The Collapse people start to resettle south of the river, on top of Mithdral.
#### Founding of New Arvandal ~ 940 DR
  All members of House Elster but Zephyr Elster pass away.
  Zephyr sees this as an opportunity to ensure his son's reign and makes his wife Avery 
    take the name Elster to mark the onset of a traditional Patriarchy.
  Zephyr declares himself The Founder of New Arvandal (the '-dral' softens).
  The House Elster and The House Vinea now begin to lose the meaning they formerly had and become perceived as just ordinary noble names.
#### Reopening of the Mountain Pass ~ 945 DR
  Balin Stonewright is in charge of repairing and redirecting inaccessible parts of the pass.
  The Bridge Elevator and bridge are constructed and henceforth maintained.
  The Tollhouse is established for its use.
  New Arvandal starts to more directly profit off of the trade route and becomes a place of prosperity again. 
#### Opening of The Vinea Academy ~ 1007 DR
  Balin Stonewright, to honor another of his mother's works, leads construction of The Academy, 
    integrating elements of The Estates' design, such as the high tower.
  Balin Stonewright becomes the first rector of The Academy and first head of discipline for Stoneworking and Machinery.
  The Academy is named Vinea Academy to honor the tragic past of New Arvandal.  
  Along with it, The Academy Elevator is built, connecting with the upper halls of Mithdral, mostly used for storage of goods,
    named The Stockpile. 
#### Beginning of Resettlement of Mithdral ~ 1010 DR
  With The Academy Elevator granting access people from the surface begin to restaurate and resettle upper Mithdral. 
  However, class divide deepens over the coming centuries, people in Mithdral and people in New Arvandal develop in parallel and less together.
  People start referring to Upper Mithdral as The Stockpile and Lower Mithdral as The Pit.
  The Pit transitions into The Underdark at the bottom end and begins to get repopulated from beneath.
  


// GAP IN HISTORY
#### Maybe was a save haven during The Goblin Wars ~ 1374 DR



#### The Pollution ~ 1497 DR
  Lingering effects of The Selera Ritual and The Blood Curse cause 
    an earthquake that shakes some underground passageways loose.
  Necromantic magic now seeps into the riverwater and radiates upstream, giving it a slight foul stench 
    and making it undrinkable.
  Life for people in The Pit begins to deteriorate at a significantly faster pace. 
#### Death of Faelan Elster ~ 1499 DR
  Count Faelan passes away and reign of New Arvandal passes on to his son Dain,
  Displeased with the workings of the merchants and the tollkeeper Walt Ashbrook, 
  Dain decides to take charge himself and relieves the tollkeeper of his duties.  
  Since Walt Ashbrook was also the caretaker of Waukeen's Chapel, 
    it is now no longer frequented apart from superficial cleaning of the main room and balcony by The Priestess.
  While Faelan respected the deities and cared about traditions and rites such as honoring the tragedy of The House Vinea, 
    Dain actively neglects such "irrelevancies" and instead focuses on more populist festivities such as fighting events.   
#### Death of Lyanna Harvestsong ~ 1502 DR
  The Priestess' daugther Lyanna falls while exploring into the 
  tower in the ruins, breaks her leg and cracks her skull.
#### Introduction of Arcane Studies ~ 1504 DR
  The Academy invites Zara Brightscale to head the new discipline. 
#### The Goblin Activity begins ~ 1505 DR
  Raids of the farm land begin to happen occasionally, 
    they are scouting parties for an Orc expedition, The Army, from 
    the Stonelands moving south through the mountains trying to reach Cormyr.
  The Army is trying to find a more direct path through the Stormhorns from The Stonelands, 
    since moving through the east past Castle Crag proves too difficult.
#### Today ~ 1507 DR

  - Slight haze in the air, cloudy. Lush gently rolling hills, Farmsteads scattered across The Plateau, in the back you see arboreal mountain ranges rise on the horizon in the west and south.
      In the east you have a steep embankment dropping down into the valley, granting a stunning view across the King's Forest in the Cormyr lowlands. (The entire Plateau is roughly 2x12km)

  AFTER THE BATTLE: 
  - The air is sharp and brisk, carrying the faint cries of goblins and goats echoing out of the woods.
  - A lone goat bleats mournfully beside an overturned trough, that and the clucking are the only sound aside from the eerie creak of the farmhouse door swinging ajar in the alpine breeze.

  - Smoke rises from the smoldering remains of the barn, and the acrid scent of burnt hay mingles with the iron tang of spilled blood.

      "In the face of darkness, he stood unyielding,
      A heart of courage, a shield for the people.
      **Captain Halric Varron**
      Born: 891 DR — Died: 935 DR
      Though the mysteries of the night elude us,
      His resolve to protect never faltered.
      May his watch now end, his spirit at peace."
#### The Crypt Level 0, Right

  **TOP**
  - The entire corridor collapsed and tilts down, the water sloshing in from the entrance flows here.
  - Rubble and dirt prevents the water from flowing faster, breaking through the rubble lets the water flow further down through a rock crevasse.
    **IF TENSION IS NEEDED**: The water from above keeps flowing in - the water level rises until this drain is unclogged. Once unclogged, there is a strong current until the water level is back to ankle deep.

  **RIGHT**
  - This corridor is elevated higher than the entrance level on the other side, Water will fill up here last. 
  - The gap to climb through quite tight, but manageable even for larger humans.
  - On the right side the floor collapsed and there is a gap leading down to **The Crypt Level 1**.


## The High Road
- [Delia Leabrace](dm/npcs.md#delia-leabrace)

- Blights attack Delia on the high road. They grew out of the ground there and corrupt the flowers and vines.

[Needle Blights (1/2)](dm/monsters.md#needle-blight)
[Leaf Blight (Minion, 1)](dm/monsters.md#leaf-blight)
[Vine Blight (1)](dm/monsters.md#vine-blight)

# Secrets

- The Goblins are a scouting branch with leader **Fizzra**, so far they have only stolen livestock. 
  The attack was not an order by their leader, but a Renegade Group, **The Bonebiters**, with their leader **Grishka**, who want to clear The Plateau to impress The Army. ??

- Lyanna Harvestsong has been missing for almost a year now.

- Kobolds steal food from the Tavern Pantry.

- Kobolds have a Kurtulmak shrine underneath Waukeen's Chapel adjacent to the smuggling tunnels.
[Kobold (1/8)](dm/monsters.md#kobold)
[Kobold Rockbruiser (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#kobold-rockbruiser)
[Kobold Inventor (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#kobold-inventor)

[Kobold Dragonshields (1)](dm/monsters.md#kobold-dragonshield)
[Kobold Scale Sorcerers (1)](dm/monsters.md#kobold-scale-sorcerer)

- Tazlyn Stonewright is Brennar's Ancestor, he still has books of hers. 

- The Guards want to pressure the Thieves' Guild out of The Stockpile. 

- The Thieves' Guild is extremely on edge but also desperate to recruit more people.

-  The dwarves referred to the underground streams flowing out underneath the river **Limvael** as **"Drinathar"** - 'Waters of Silver'.


# UNSORTED

- Wild animals in the mountains aggressive and push down towards the plateau. (the army does something that pushes them away?)
- Some of the people that live in the mountains haven't been seen in a while? (something is going on in the mountains?)


- **Berric Morgrim.** Missing tooth, patchy beard. (jittering hand)
thief threatens XYZ and then rushes to sewer entrance
> Kazimir knows Berric's jittering hand symptoms as likely caused by Black Lotus, which.. well, refining it makes money.

[TODO] Some of the elves in the crypt are from scorpion tribe? makes for great loot spots.

[TODO] Bok NPC (Kazimir student colleague)

person dying, 30 seconds timer, 1 scroll of revivify, patron takes soul if they die.

Alenna gets reprimanded by Dain for not having enough power for purifications the previous day. (she healed Nyari and one person that fell in the elevator shaft)

Evil priest begins to cast spell on child, Alenna steps in, alenna gets hit.

Council with Dain, Merchants, and Academy members want a report from players. (topic of putting evil priest in position of waukeen's chapel comes up as tangent?) 

Trepidation (feeling of fear or anxiety about something that may happen.)

Parties involved in grasping power in the city: 
- Academy and Merchants (want to keep the decisionmaking in their hands)
- Dain and the Guard (Wants to gentrify the Stockpile to stabilize their finances against the merchants' influence)
- Thieves' Guild (Wants independent trade flow from Dain, independence from the merchants)

Dalereckoning (DR) and Cormyr Reckoning (CR = DR-25) both used in the past, New Arvandal is using primarily DR historically because of the closeness to the elves of Cormanthyr.
