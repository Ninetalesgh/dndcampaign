### Toadstool Mace
mace, rare, attunement

This mace is made in the likeness of a toadstool. It releases a gentle plume of glimmering spores when swung. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you hit a creature with this weapon and roll a 6 on the weapon's damage die, roll a d4 and consult the table below. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be subjected to an effect based on the number rolled on the d4. A creature that doesn't need to breathe automatically succeeds on the saving throw.


### Lazar's Magic Eye
wondrous item, rare, attunement by a creature missing an eye
You can use this magic item as a replacement for a missing eye, even if you're not attuned to it. While it's in your eye socket, it can’t be removed by anyone other than you, and you can see through the item as though it were a normal eye. While it's in your eye socket and you're attuned to it, you can use an action to activate one of its two properties. Once a property has been used, that property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Lazar's Beam. You glare at a target that you can see within 120 feet of you. When you do, the eye charges up and releases a beam of concentrated flame at the target. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. For every 6 rolled on the damage dice, the resulting explosion deals 6 fire damage to other creatures within a cumulative 5 feet of the target, up to a maximum of 30 fire damage. For example, if you rolled three 6s on the fire damage dice, each other creature within 15 feet of the target would also take 18 damage.

Lazar's Sight. You gain truesight out to a range of 120 feet for 10 minutes. For the duration, you can also tell the radiant temperature of targets you use an action to inspect.


### Mighty Falconer's Mitt
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

This oversized glove can be worn over an existing gauntlet or similar hand covering. It has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can use an action to expend 1 of the glove's charges to summon a spectral falcon to your outstretched, gloved hand. When you do, choose one of the following two options:

Scout. The falcon immediately flies up to 60 feet and becomes invisible (like a scrying sensor). Until the end of your turn, you can choose to see through the falcon's eyes, instead of your own, using its senses. The effect then ends.

Strike. The falcon streaks from your hand in an ethereal blur, extending from you in a 60-foot line that's 5 feet wide. Each creature within that line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d4 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A hostile creature that's in the line and within 5 feet of at least one of your allies makes the saving throw with disadvantage.

### Bag of Forging Coals
Wondrous item, uncommon

When found, this leather bag is filled with 1d6 + 2 smoldering coals. They remain hot within the bag, keeping it warm to the touch on the outside. When a coal is placed in a fire, such as a campfire or forge, the fire remains at its optimal temperature (based on its original intended use) for the next 8 hours without having to add any additional fuel to it. At the end of the 8 hours or when the coal is removed from the fire, roll a d4: on a 1, the coal sputters out and ceases to be magical. A creature that finishes a short or long rest within 15 feet of such a fire gains 2d4 temporary hit points.

Alternatively, you can use an action to drag a coal across a nonmagical weapon. For the next 8 hours, that weapon deals an extra 1d4 fire damage to any target it hits. When you use the coal in this way, it then ceases to be magical.

### Waterwine Goblet
Wondrous item, common

This glass goblet has a colored tint to the outside, which undulates around the glass. Flicking the glass with your finger using an action causes the color to alternate between deep red, pink, and a light golden color. Water that's drunk from the glass tastes like a fine wine that corresponds to the glass's color: red, rosé, or white, respectively.

I love hydrating with wine.
### Comet Dart
Weapon (dart), uncommon

This five-pointed dart is decorated with pieces of ever-frozen ice. When thrown, a streak of shimmering icy dust trails behind it. A target hit by the dart takes an extra 3d4 cold damage; it then takes 1d4 cold damage again at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. The effect ends early if the target takes any fire damage or it uses an action to fall prone and roll on the ground. Whenever you roll a 4 on the cold damage dealt in this way, the target's speed is reduced by a cumulative 10 feet; this effect can't reduce a creature's speed below 10 feet. This penalty lasts for 10 minutes or until the target takes any fire damage.

Once the dart hits a target, this property ceases to function until the next dawn. Until then, a target hit by the dart takes an extra 1d4 cold damage, but doesn't suffer any penalties to its speed.

Even the boldest learn that haste can falter beneath the weight of the stars.
### Ring of Silverware
Ring, common

While wearing this ring, you can use a bonus action to mentally command the ring to transform into a fork, spoon, or other harmless element of a set of cook's utensils (such as a ladle or spatula). The transformed ring returns to its normal form on your finger if you mentally end the effect (no action required) or are no longer holding it.

Every food is finger food.
### Iron Rose
Weapon (morningstar), rare (requires attunement)

The head of this morningstar is in the shape of a rose. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The weapon has two forms: bloom form (if the weapon is in bright light) or bud form (if the weapon is in dim light or darkness). Iron petals unfurl from the weapon's spiked head while in bloom form, and enclose it while in bud form. While in bud form, the weapon deals bludgeoning damage, instead of piercing.

While holding the weapon, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (spell save DC 15): entangle (bud form only), protection from poison (any form), or spike growth (bloom form only). Once a spell has been cast from the weapon, it can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.

A rose without its thorns is beauty without pain, love without loss, or a hero without a villain: to know both is what makes it special.

### Greatstone's Grasp
Weapon (greatclub), rare

This stone greatclub is made from the arm and hand of a hulking earth elemental. Its titanic fist opens and closes. When you hit a creature with the club and roll an even number on the damage die, the fist closes on the target: the target of the attack must then succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be grappled by the fist. The fist can only grapple one creature at a time; a creature that is at least one size larger than you automatically succeeds on the saving throw against it. You can release a held creature at any time (no action required); letting go of the club releases any creature grappled by it. While holding the grappling club, your speed is halved (moving the held creature with you), and you can't attack with it. Instead, you can forgo making an attack with the club to push a grappled creature up to 10 feet away from you. A grappled creature can use an action on its turn to make the Strength saving throw again, escaping from the grapple on a success.

The earth remembers, and it doesn't let go.


### Rejuvenating Bandage
Wondrous item, uncommon

You can wrap this bandage around a willing creature's wounds over the course of 1 minute. The next time a creature finishes a short rest while wrapped with the bandage, it regains 3d8 + 3 hit points. If you have a severed body part and bandage it to the matching creature's stump, the bandage also causes the limb to magically knit to the stump at the end of the rest. Either way, the bandage then loses its magic and falls from the wound.

"So you're sure that herding axe beaks is… safe, right?"

"Of course! And, if it does go bad, we'll just put you back together again."


### Snow Silver
Wondrous item, uncommon

This silver coin is ornamented with snowflake designs. It's always cold to the touch, and it can magically cool up to 1 pint of liquid it's placed in over the course of 6 seconds.

If the coin is on your person when you take cold damage, the damage is halved, and the coin frosts over. This property of the coin then ceases to function until the next dawn, at which point the coin defrosts.


### Slippers of the Rat
Wondrous item, uncommon

While wearing these slippers, ordinary rats (including giant rats and swarms of rats) are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. Furthermore, you can use a bonus action to speak the slippers' command word to transform into a rat (as if by the polymorph spell) until the end of your next turn; your alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are unchanged for the duration of the spell. You return to your normal form early if you drop to 0 hit points or if you choose to end the effect (no action required). If there isn't enough space for you to return to your normal form, you immediately take 1d10 force damage and are magically returned to the nearest unoccupied space from which you came. This property of the slippers can be used twice, and they regain any expended uses daily at dawn.

  
Squeak squeak, sneak sneak


### Bottled Talent
Elixir, uncommon

When you drink this potion, you gain proficiency with one skill, saving throw, or tool of your choice for 24 hours. The glowing potion has a glimmering swirl at its center.

"Hey, are you sure you can do this? I've never seen you dance before."
"Of course I can. Hold my helmet."


### Bag of Irresistible Leaves
Wondrous item, uncommon

This small bag sounds like it's filled with an impossible number of crunchy, fallen leaves. You can use an action to open the bag and upend it on the ground into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. A pile of leaves then falls from the bag, filling a 5-foot cube in that space. A creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the leaves and can see them must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to leap into the pile until the end of the turn. The compelled creature must use its movement to reach and leap into the pile, taking the Dash action if necessary, and remain in that space for the rest of the turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw or is no longer compelled by the pile of leaves is immune to the effect for the next 24 hours. A creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw if it can't be charmed or if moving to the leaves would be directly harmful to it.

The pile of leaves dissipates after 1 hour. It dissipates early if a creature leaps into it or if it's blown away by a moderate wind of 10 miles per hour or greater. The bag can hold enough leaves to make 3 piles, and it regains enough leaves for 1d3 new ones daily at dawn.

It's truly impossible to leaf it alone.

## Mirage Leathers
Armor (leather), uncommon (requires attunement)

This stark white armor tricks the eye in strong light, like a mirage. While wearing this armor, other creatures take a −5 penalty to any Wisdom (Perception) checks they make to see you, provided you're in bright light or sunlight. In addition, you can use an action to cast the mirror image spell. This version of the spell ends early if you start your turn without being in bright light or sunlight. For the duration of the spell, you can take the Hide action as a bonus action, and remain hidden, even if you're in plain sight. Once the armor has been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

### Medium's Rod
Rod, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

While holding this rod, ghosts and similar incorporeal creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you can't become possessed. The rod has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dusk.

Cursing Flames. You can use an action while holding the rod to expend 1 or more of its charges to hurl ghostly flames at a target within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack for each expended charge, using your spell attack bonus; each attack can be against the same target or different ones. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 fire damage and is cursed for 1 minute. While cursed, the target can't benefit from being invisible, and you can use an action to automatically deal 1d4 fire damage to it for each flame it's cursed by. The curse ends early if the target is ever more than 60 feet away from you. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points while it's cursed, the curse ends, and you regain 1 charge for each flame it was cursed by. The fire damage dice become d6s and deal radiant damage if the target is undead.

See Invisibility. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the see invisibility spell from it. For the duration of the spell, you have advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with undead.


"Spirits! You needn't suffer the realms beyond: come forth, and be at peace at last. Begone!"

### Mycelial Staff
Staff, uncommon

This staff is made of a cluster of bioluminscent mushrooms atop a mycelial column. While holding it, it emits dim light in a 10-foot radius. You can use an action while holding the staff to plant it in the ground at your feet, sending out a magical network of branching, mycelial roots in a 60-foot-radius circle, centered on the staff and spreading around corners. The roots remain for 1 minute or until you move or are no longer holding the staff. For the duration, you and any other creature touching the staff gains tremorsense within the roots' area, out to a range of 60 feet. A creature that has this tremorsense has advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) check it makes to detect a creature within the area, and can make the check as if it were in any space within the roots' area. Once this property of the staff has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.


"So how did you know about the hidden basement?"

"Oh, I have an extensive underground network."


### Alchemy Blade
Weapon (shortsword), uncommon

This sword has a glass channel running down its length. In place of a traditional pommel, it instead has an open hole designed to fit atop a typical flask or vial. While holding the sword, you can use an action to attach a flask or vial to the pommel and draw its contents into the blade; doing so changes the sword's properties based on the attached flask or vial.

    Acid Vial. The sword deals an extra 1d4 acid damage to the first target hit by it each turn. When the target is an object that isn't being worn or carried, the acid damage is maximized.

    Alchemist's Fire. The sword deals an extra 1d4 fire damage to the first target hit by it each turn. If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using the sword, you can cause a different creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target to also take 2d4 fire damage.

    Basic Poison. The sword deals an extra 1d4 poison damage to the first target hit by it each turn. The first time that the target hits with an attack that uses Strength before the start of your next turn, the damage is reduced by an amount equal to the poison damage dealt.

    Holy Water. The sword deals an extra 1d4 radiant damage to the first target hit by it each turn. The radiant damage is doubled against fiends and undead.

You can eject and remove the flask or vial using a bonus action, destroying its contents and leaving the container empty.


### Scorpion Glaive
Weapon (glaive), uncommon

This glaive is gently curved. It magically straightens when you thrust it forward. On a hit, the weapon deals either piercing or slashing damage (your choice each time). When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a creature, that creature must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature takes 1d6 poison damage at the start of each of its turns; it can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns for the duration, ending the effect on a success.


### Ballista Pike
Weapon (glaive), uncommon

This glaive is gently curved. It magically straightens when you thrust it forward. On a hit, the weapon deals either piercing or slashing damage (your choice each time). When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a creature, that creature must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature takes 1d6 poison damage at the start of each of its turns; it can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns for the duration, ending the effect on a success.


### Gibbering Candle
Wondrous item, uncommon

This oozing, red wax candle provides the same light as a normal candle. Twisted faces contort ever worse as the candle melts. A creature within the candle's light hears a telepathic and incoherent babbling, which gets louder as you near the candle. When a creature that can see the candle enters the candle's light for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of its next turn; a creature makes this saving throw with disadvantage if it's within the candle's bright light. A creature incapacitated in this way can only move toward the candle for the rest of the turn. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the candle or anything within its light until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the candle or something within its light in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 1 hour, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 10 minutes from the candle's total burn time.

### Pickpocket's Pouch
Wondrous item, uncommon

This black leather bag sits on your hip to provide easy access when depositing handheld items. It opens and closes silently, and it can stretch to fit about 1 cubic foot of space. You gain a +1 bonus to Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made while wearing this bag. Objects in the bag can't be detected or seen by divination magic, such as by the scrying spell or locate object.

The bag has a latch that can be opened in one of two ways. Opening it the first way reveals the inside of the bag as normal. Opening it the second way causes an illusion to appear over the objects in the bag; the illusion is of five loose copper pieces, a quill and ink, and a waterskin. To discern that the contents are an illusion, a creature can use its action to inspect the pouch and must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The illusion also fails to hold up to physical inspection.

A bit o' misdirection, a flick o' the wrist, and what was thine is now mine.


### Death Brand
Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement)

This magic dagger teleports back to your hand immediately after you make a ranged attack with it. The dagger has 4 charges, and it regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

When you hit a creature with this dagger, you can expend 1 of the weapon's charges to mark it for death: you sense the general direction of a marked creature's location, as long as it remains within 1,000 feet of you. If the marked creature is within 60 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to teleport to a random unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature and immediately make an attack against it using the dagger. The attack roll is made with advantage. If the target is more than 60 feet away from you or if there are no unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of it, nothing happens, and the action is wasted.

A mark lasts for 10 minutes. The mark ends early if you mark another creature, if you're ever more than 1,000 feet away from it, or if you use the dagger to teleport (even if it fails).

Now run. I love a good chase.


### Crack of Thunder
Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement)

While holding this sword, you have resistance to lightning damage. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.

Energy Surge. Before you make an attack with this weapon, you can cause it to split apart into a group of bladed segments. The segments are suspended in the air and are held together by a powerful electrical force. The reach of your attack is increased by 15 feet, and any target you hit with it takes an extra 2d6 lightning damage from the attack, instead of 1d6. Hit or miss, cracks of thunder erupt from the point of impact. Each creature within 10 feet of the target (other than you) must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 thunder damage. If you hit the target with the attack, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage. The weapon then returns to its normal form. This property of the weapon can't be used again until 8 hours have passed or until 10 or more lightning damage is dealt to you (before applying resistance or immunity).

Lightning Rod. Whenever a creature within 40 feet of you takes lightning damage, you can use your reaction to take some or all of that lightning damage instead. When you do, electricity arcs from the other creature to you. You choose how much lightning damage to reduce the triggering effect by; you then take that amount of lightning damage instead.

### Mistwalkers
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

Your walking speed is increased by 10 feet while wearing these boots. While in fog, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed; you move through the air as if you're walking.

Once on each of your turns when you walk 30 or more feet on the ground in a straight line, you can immediately cast the misty step spell from the boots (no action required). When you do, you teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you that's along the same straight line and in the same direction in which you were moving. This property of the boots can be used four times. The boots regain one use of this property for every hour they aren't used to teleport

### Swallowtail Mantle
Wondrous item, rare

While wearing this mantle, when you move 10 or more feet before jumping, the maximum distance of your jump is increased by 10 feet. In addition, when you fall at least 20 feet while wearing this mantle, you can use your reaction to grip its edges with both hands. While holding the edges, you fly at a speed of 30 feet, but cannot fly upwards without a significant updraft. Unless you're lifted by an updraft, you descend 15 feet at the end of each of your turns. If you land on the ground while flying in this way, you take no damage from falling. You lose this flying speed if you ever fail to grip the mantle's edges.

### Healer's Voice
Wondrous item, rare

This silver and gold necklace hums with a healing energy when you speak certain arcane words. Whenever you cast the healing word or mass healing word spell, you can grant one target of the spell 4 temporary hit points for each d4 that rolled a 4. If you roll a 1 on a d4, you can reroll the die. You must use the new roll.

In addition, whenever you make an ability check to calm, heal, or otherwise soothe another creature, you can roll a d4 and add it to the total. Once this property of the necklace has been used, it can't be used again until you or another creature has cast healing word or mass healing word while wearing the necklace.

### Ring of Salt
Ring, rare

This clear ring is made of crystalline salt. Donning or removing the ring requires an action. While wearing this ring, ghosts can neither move through nor possess you. If a ghost is already in your space or possessing you when you put on the ring of salt, it's forcibly ejected from you to the nearest unoccupied space and takes 1d10 force damage. Furthermore, the first time on each of your turns when you move through a ghost's space, that ghost must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be pushed to the nearest unoccupied space and take 1d10 force damage. Each time a ghost is forcibly ejected or pushed by the ring, the ring has a 10 percent chance of being destroyed and crumbling into a negligible pile of salt.

### Ring of Vitality
Ring, rare (requires attunement)

While wearing this ring, your hit point maximum increases by 10, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced by any means short of a wish spell.

### Celestial Bident
Weapon (trident), legendary (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)

This bident's prongs are designed as celestial wings. A ball of pure light radiates between the wings, which sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight. While holding the bident, you can use a bonus action to light or extinguish the ball. Alternatively, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 40 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each. If you're attuned to the celestial bident, you are considered proficient with it.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage to any target it hits while the ball of pure light is present in the bident. Immediately after you make a ranged weapon attack with the bident, it flies back to your open hand. While holding the weapon, you also gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.

Bestow Light. While the ball of light is present between the bident's prongs, you can use an action to touch a creature with the bident and confer the light into them. The ball disappears within the creature for 8 hours. For the duration, the creature can't be blinded, deafened, diseased, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned. If the creature is already affected by such a condition, the effects are suppressed for the duration of this effect. The ball of light returns to the bident at the end of the 8 hours or when the creature is reduced to 0 hit points. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, the ball lifts from the creature's body and returns to the bident, and the creature immediately regains 1 hit point. Once a creature has benefitted from this property, it can't do so again for 24 hours.

Guiding Bident. While holding the weapon, you can use an action to cast the guiding bolt spell from it, using your spell attack bonus. When you do, the bolt appears as a duplicate of the bident made of pure light, and on a hit, any allied creature within 10 feet of the target gains 10 temporary hit points.


### Pauldron of the Lost Legion
[TODO] Rework this for something the elves of cormanthyr had, the artwork is cool
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)

This pauldron is made of mourningsteel, a metal sometimes found below ancient battlegrounds. A tattered capelet bearing a crest hangs from it.

You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this pauldron. In addition, whenever you roll initiative and aren't surprised, you can immediately move up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, provided your speed isn't 0. While moving in this way, you can move through another creature's space, regardless of its size, and such a creature's space isn't considered difficult terrain for you. Your appearance becomes slightly ghost-like for the duration of this movement; you can force one creature you move through in this way to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 force damage on a failed save. While wearing the pauldron, you also have advantage on saving throws against effects from undead.

The pauldron has the spirits of 10 long-lost souls trapped within its metal. While wearing it, you can use the pauldron's following properties by calling upon the trapped souls; these properties use a spell attack bonus of +9 and spell save DC of 17. The pauldron regains the use of 1d8 + 2 spirits daily at dawn.

Spells. You can use an action to cast either the guardian of faith (4 spirits) or spirit guardians (3 spirits) spell from the pauldron. The spells appear as a ghostly formation of stalwart soldiers or a swirling whirlwind of weaponry, respectively.

Retaliate. When you take damage from another creature you can see within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to use 1 of the pauldron's spirits to make a melee spell attack against the triggering creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 4 force damage, and you gain 10 temporary hit points.

Spirit Swarm. As an action, you can use 3 or more spirits from the pauldron to create a formation of ghostly soldiers. The soldiers appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. Treat the soldiers as a Large undead swarm: they can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and they can move through any opening as small as 1-inch across. The swarm has 10 hit points for every spirit used to create it, and it can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points. It has immunity to all damage and effects, but loses 10 hit points at the end of each of your subsequent turns. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to move the swarm up to 30 feet and make a melee spell attack against a creature in its space. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 + 4 force damage, or half as much damage if the swarm has fewer than half its hit points remaining. The swarm vanishes once it reaches 0 hit points. It vanishes early if you dismiss it (no action required) or if it's targeted by the dispel evil and good spell or similar magic.

Sentience. The pauldron of the lost legion is a sentient lawful good item with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 17. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The pauldron communicates telepathatically with its wearer and can speak, read, and understand Common. The pauldron's voice is cacophonous and echoing in your mind.

Personality. The pauldron of the lost legion's sentience is divided between the 10 spirits trapped inside, which were all a part of the same battalion long ago. Even once a spirit is used as part of one of the pauldron's properties, it returns to the item and can still be heard among their voices. The dominant personality of the pauldron is that of the battalion's leader, a gruff and tired man named Elrik Viccar. He is followed for eternity by his fellow soldiers, despite his wishes for them to pass on. Elrik is plagued with guilt and is certain that his actions led to his comrades' undeserved deaths.

Purifying the Pauldron. Unburdening Elrik of his guilt (which can be done at the GM's discretion) causes the pauldron to become purified, transforming it into a gold-hued metal called solacesteel when it happens. The solacesteel version of this item isn't sentient, but the spirits' spell attacks use a d8 damage die, instead of a d6.


### Verdant Breastplate
Armor (breastplate), rare (requires attunement)

When found, this breastplate resembles a leather cuirass covered in large, dried leaves. Once you wear and attune to it, however, it springs to life and flourishes; its leaves remain pliable and flexible, but harden against incoming harm to protect you. Sleeping in this armor has no adverse effect on you.

While wearing this armor, moving through nonmagical plants that impede movement (such as by creating difficult terrain) costs you no extra movement, and you don't take damage from nonmagical plant hazards such as thorns or spines. In addition, the entangle spell has no effect on you, and you have advantage on any Dexterity (Stealth) check you make to hide in areas of dense foliage.

Charges. This armor has 7 charges and regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you're a druid or ranger and have cast the plant growth spell from the armor within the last 24 hours, the armor regains all expended charges instead.

Spells. While wearing this armor, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast either the entangle (1 charges) or plant growth (3 charges) spell from it, using a spell save DC of 15. If you're a druid or ranger, you can choose to cast the spell from the armor using your spell save DC instead.

When you cast plant growth using this armor, the plants affected by the spell are enriched for 30 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

### Fireamber scepter
Rod, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

A fire beetle has been preserved within the amber of this otherwise twisted wooden rod. While holding it, you can use an action to cast the dancing lights spell from it. When you do, the light is warm and fiery, and at the center of each glowing orb is an illusory, ghostly fire beetle; the glowing orbs can be combined to form a beetle-like shape. Alternatively, while you're holding the scepter, you can cause its amber head to glow, shedding warm bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The scepter continues to glow until you drop it or end the effect (no action required).

Beetle Fire. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast the faerie fire spell from it, using your spell save DC. This version of the spell also creates a swarm of insects (which appear as Tiny fire beetles) immediately after you cast the spell. The swarm appears in a space of your choice within the spell's area. For the duration of the spell, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause the swarm to fly up to 60 feet toward a creature outlined by the spell and use its bite attack on it if it ends this movement in the creature's space. The swarm uses your spell attack bonus to hit, instead of its normal bonus. Once this property of the rod has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Illuminated Weapon. While the rod is glowing, it can also be used as a magic club. When you attack with the rod, you can use your spellcasting ability modifier, instead of Strength, for the attack and damage rolls.

### Voidknight's Maul
Weapon (maul), very rare (requires attunement by a paladin)

The crystalline head of this magic hammer has been bathed in the latent magic of the Astral Plane for untold millennia. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While you remain attuned to it, you age at one-tenth your normal rate.

Astral Smite. Whenever you use your Divine Smite feature against a creature, you can choose for it to deal psychic damage instead of radiant damage. Furthermore, when you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to use your Divine Smite, you can force the target of the attack to make a Constitution saving throw against your paladin spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is affected by the levitate spell. This version of the spell can affect multiple creatures at once, though you must still concentrate on the spell as normal. If your concentration on the spell ends, any affected creature gently floats back to the ground. Otherwise, you can use your action to move one or multiple targets affected by the spell vertically, up to 20 feet, dividing the movement between them. Each affected creature must remain within the spell's range.

### Shield of the Eldritch Maw
Armor (shield), very rare

The face of this shield is seemingly made of teeth, with a clear, fanglike line through its center. While holding this shield, you have a +2 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

Whenever a creature makes a melee attack roll against you while you're holding the shield, you can use your reaction to make a special melee attack with the shield against that target, with an attack bonus of +8. When you do, the shield splits apart to form a toothy maw, which opens wide and bites down on the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage plus 1d6 psychic damage. If you roll a 20 on the attack roll, the target is magically shunted to a special demiplane within the shield. The creature remains in the demiplane until you end the effect (no action required) or until you doff the shield, to a maximum of 1 minute, during which time it takes 1d4 acid damage plus 3d6 psychic damage at the end of each of its turns. A creature reduced to 0 hit points in the demiplane is devoured. At the start of each of its turns, the shunted creature can make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, it escapes the demiplane and reappears in the nearest unoccupied space to the shield. Only one creature can be in the demiplane at a time.


### Hunter's Cup
Wondrous item, rare

This wooden goblet is covered in a soft layer of moss. Three twisted antlers encircle it. It holds 1 cup of liquid.

When the goblet is filled from a free-flowing stream or pond, it begins to glow with a soft energy. Drinking the full goblet of glowing water using an action grants you the following benefits until you finish a short or long rest (to a maximum of 24 hours):

    You gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and Wisdom checks.
     
    You gain a +2 bonus to the damage rolls of your ranged weapon attacks.
     
    Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.
     
    Any bonus granted by the goblet is doubled while you're within a forest.

The water in the goblet ceases to glow after 24 hours or if it's moved more than 100 feet away from where it was filled. Once a creature has drunk from the goblet in this way, it can't be used again until 1d4 days have passed.


### Silver Dragon Katana
Weapon (longsword), rare

This shimmering silver katana is always cold to the touch, and a flurry of snow and ice trails behind it whenever it's swung. This sword has the finesse property, and when you hit with an attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d4 cold damage.

You can use an action to speak the weapon's command word and swing it down in front of you. When you do, a blast of freezing winds erupts in a 30-foot cone from the blade. Each creature within that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw as it's struck by the flurry of icy shrapnel. A creature takes 2d6 slashing damage, 2d6 piercing damage, and 2d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. Once this property of the sword has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.


### Worker's Wondrous Ladder
Rod, common

This wooden rod looks like the base of a simple ladder. While holding it, you can speak its command word using an action to cause a number of duplicate rods of your choice to appear, attached to the one you're holding. You must be holding the rod parallel to the ground; the rods attach in a vertical stack to create a ladder, starting from the rod you're holding. Each duplicate rod increases the height of the ladder by 1 foot, up to a maximum height of 20 feet. If this causes the ladder to hit another creature or object, it immediately stops short of that height. Each rod weighs 1 pound.

While holding one of the rods, you can use an action to speak its command word again to cause every other attached rod to magically disappear, leaving you with a single rod again.

"Oy! Throw me that ladder!"

### Metallurgists Grip
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This plated metal gauntlet extends up your arm. The armored plates are extensively corroded. If you're missing a hand or arm, the item can function as a prosthesis for it. While you're attuned to the gauntlet, it can't be removed from you against your will, and you have resistance to acid damage.

While wearing the gauntlet or using it as a prosthesis, you gain the following properties.

Absorb Acid. You can use your reaction whenever you take acid damage to reduce the acid damage you take by 2d6 + 3. When you do, the next melee weapon attack you make before the end of your next turn deals extra acid damage equal to the acid damage it reduced.

Caustic Overdrive. You can use a bonus action to cast the haste spell on yourself from the gauntlet. When you do, the spell doesn't require concentration, and you must roll a d6 at the end of each of your turns. You take acid damage equal to the result of the d6, which can't be prevented or reduced in any way. On a 1, the spell ends. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Winterland Footwraps
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a monk)

These blue straps keep a soft fur wrap held against your legs. While wearing them, you have resistance to cold damage, and the first time you hit a target with an unarmed strike on each of your turns, the target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage from the attack. In addition, you can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check, and difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost you extra movement.

When you use your Step of the Wind feature while wearing the wraps, you can walk on water until the end of your turn. When you do, the water beneath your feet magically freezes into a walkable path of floating ice, allowing you to step on it freely. The ice melts after 1 minute.

### Forest Eye Staff
Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)

While this staff is on your person, you can't be surprised. If you're in a forest, jungle, or similarly wooded area, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while holding the staff, and you can use an action to cast the locate animals or plants spell from it. This spell can't be cast from the staff again until the next dawn.

The staff has a magical leaf that flutters above its top. While holding the staff, you can use an action to speak its command word to cause the leaf to drift up to 30 feet away from the staff in a direction of your choice, as if it were carried by a breeze. You mentally receive visual information from the leaf, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet, and can look in every direction. The leaf can pass through any opening large enough for a leaf to slip through. The leaf then withers and turns to dust at the start of your next turn, but a new one magically appears above the staff at the next dawn.

### Cerberus Whistle
Wondrous item, rare


This whistle has been carved from a soot-stained imp bone. While holding the whistle, you can use an action to blow it. The whistle can be heard out to a range of 300 feet, but only by fiends and tieflings.

The whistle has three dog heads carved into its end. When found, the dogs' mouths are closed. When you blow into the whistle, one, two, or three of the mouths open (your choice each time). The harder you blow the whistle, the more of the dogs' mouths magically open.

For each mouth that opens as part of blowing the whistle, a hell hound is magically summoned to a random space that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each hell hound remains for 1 minute or until it's reduced to 0 hit points. If you are a fiend or tiefling, the hounds are friendly to you and your companions. Otherwise, each hounds' disposition is random: use the table below to determine the nature of each hound.

d6 | Disposition
:-- | :--
1 | Thehound is hostile towards you and your companions. It uses its action to attack you first
2-3 | The hound is equally hostile towards all creatures. It prioritizes the nearest creature to it that isn't a fiend or tiefling.
4-6 | The hound is friendly to you and your companions. It becomes hostile if you or one of your allies does something to harm or threaten it.

Roll initiative for the summoned hounds as a group, which has its own turns; hounds that are friendly to you go first. While the hounds are friendly to you, they obey your verbal commands (no action required). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.


### Staff of the Iron Cauldron
Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)


This iron staff has a thorny cauldron mounted at its head, which belches a noxious fume from its mouth. Grass and similarly Tiny mundane plants wither when its twisted end is planted on them. This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and it is always under the effects of the shillelagh spell.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: acid arrow (2 charges), antilife shell (5 charges), blight (4 charges), grease (1 charge), poison spray (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level), or stinking cloud (3 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff explodes into smoke and all plant life within 500 feet flourishes.

### Necromancer's Cuff
[TODO] cool artwork, for Warlock
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

The fingers of this dark silver ear cuff move to gently hold onto your ear. While wearing it, undead creatures can always understand the literal meaning of any language that you speak. In addition, you gain 3 temporary hit points whenever a living creature within 30 feet of you is slain. You can gain these temporary hit points even when you have 0 hit points: when you do, you're immediately stabilized, but are still unconscious.

### Amulet of the Guiding Eye
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)


This amulet features two eye-like pendants: one humanoid and one bestial. If you're within 5 feet of a friendly beast, such as a beast companion or familiar (including one created by the find familiar spell), you ignore the effects of being blinded, provided the beast isn't also blinded.

You can use an action to charm a Small or smaller beast that you're touching or that you can see within 30 feet of you, provided that it isn't hostile towards you. The beast is charmed by you for 24 hours, and it is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. This effect ends early if you use this feature again or if you or your companions do anything harmful to it. You can use an action to see through the beast's eyes while it's within 30 feet of you, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal sight. While seeing through the beast's eyes, you gain the benefits of any special senses that rely on sight possessed by that creature, though you are blinded to your own surroundings. Unless you have another way to command or control the beast, it shares your initiative in combat and uses its movement to remain within 5 feet of you. On its turn, it takes either the Dash or Dodge action.

### Unstoppable Heart
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This smooth, copper device looks a bit like a mechanical heart. Glowing red solution moves through its internal chambers and valves in perfect sequence. As part of attuning to the heart, you must hold it against your chest for the duration. Once you're attuned to it, it magically vanishes within your chest and begins to beat alongside your normal heart.

While inside your body, the heart grants you the following benefits:

     
    You can move an additional 10 feet whenever you take the Dash action.
     
    You have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to resist poison and to endure a forced march.
     
    You have resistance to poison damage.
     
    Whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, you double the number of hit points it restores.
     
    You stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn.
     
    You reduce your exhaustion level by two whenever you finish a long rest, instead of one.

If your attunement to the heart ends, it magically appears in your open hand or in the nearest unoccupied space.

### Cloak of Smoke and Cinder
[TODO] works nicely with wand of incense
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This short, hooded mantle is in threadbare tatters after being burned in a magical fire. While wearing it, the embers of that fire still burn, and plumes of smoke drape downward to replace the parts of the cloak that were lost.

While wearing the cloak, you have resistance to fire damage and ignore any penalties that come as a result of a target being obscured by smoke. It also functions as a cape of the mountebank.

Whenever another creature hits you with an attack on its turn while you're wearing the cloak, a cloud of smoke billows outward from the cloak, which heavily obscures you and the area around you in a 10-foot-radius sphere. The smoke vanishes at the end of the turn; a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) also disperses the smoke. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move, as well as while you're in an area of moderate or greater wind.


### Explorer's Helm
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While wearing this helmet, you're considered proficient with cartographer's tools. You also have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks, and you always know which way is north if you're outside. In addition, if you've been traveling at a consistent pace for at least 1 hour, nonmagical difficult terrain doesn't slow your travel while you continue at that pace.

### Quillgun
Weapon (blowgun), uncommon

This magic blowgun is made from a rough spruce branch. At its end is a collection of sharp porcupine quills. The blowgun has 30 quills and regains all expended quills daily at dawn; it then loads itself with 6 of those quills, unless it was already loaded with other ammunition.

If the blowgun is loaded with 6 quills in this way, it shoots each of those quills simultaneously at the same target when you make a ranged attack with it. You still make a single attack roll with the blowgun when you do, and you add your Dexterity modifier to the total of the attack's damage. On a hit, roll a d6 to determine how many of the quills hit the target; you then roll a number of d4s equal to the result, and the target takes piercing damage equal to the total of the d4s. At the end of the turn, the blowgun magically reloads itself with 6 new quills, unless you already loaded it with other ammunition.

The blowgun can also be wielded as a magic club. While it has at least 6 quills remaining, it deals an extra 1d4 piercing damage to any target it hits.

### Twin-Tuned Hammer
Weapon (light hammer), very rare (requires attunement)


This two-pronged hammer vibrates with a powerful force whenever it strikes a target. Despite the thunderous nature, the sound it creates can only be heard up to 30 feet away. A target hit with the hammer takes an extra 2d8 thunder damage from the attack, or 3d8 thunder damage if the target is made of stone, metal, or glass.

Whenever the hammer deals this bonus thunder damage, it continues to vibrate until the end of your next turn. If you're a bard, you gain the following benefits while holding it for the duration:
   
    Any target you grant a Bardic Inspiration die to also gains an additional Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d4. This d4 can't be used at the same time as the other Bardic Inspiration die, and lasts until the end of your next turn.
     
    You can roll a d4 and add it to your bard spell save DC whenever you cast a spell that deals thunder damage. This bonus ends immediately after you cast the spell.

### Bangle of Sun and Moon
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)


This bangle features a personified sun and moon, transitioning from gold to silver midway through the band. Three small diamonds mark their eyes. While wearing the bangle, you always know how long it is until sunrise, sunset, midday, and midnight.

The bangle has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can expend 2 of the bangle's charges to cast the daylight spell from it. Alternatively, you can expend 1 or more of the bangle's charges to cast the moonbeam spell from it (save DC 13). For 1 charge, you cast the 2nd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend. When you expend 2 or more charges to cast moonbeam in this way, you can choose whether the spell's damage type is cold, fire, or radiant.

If you have 11 or more levels in the druid class and are wearing this bangle, you can expend 3 charges from the bangle to cast the sunbeam spell from it (save DC 13). When you do, there is a permanent and cumulative 25 percent chance that the bangle is destroyed when the spell ends.

### Amulet of Initiative
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This amulet is actually a small gong-like bell. It emits a loud ring whenever you roll initiative, which is audible out to a range of 100 feet. You have advantage on initiative rolls while wearing the amulet. Further, your speed increases by 10 feet until the start of your second turn of combat, and you gain the following special reaction:

Knockout Parry. The first time you're hit with an attack before the start of your second turn of each combat, you can use your reaction to immediately make a single weapon attack against the attacker. This reaction can be used even if you're surprised, and allows you to draw a stowed weapon as part of it. If the total of your attack roll is equal to or lower than the attacker's, the triggering attack hits you, and yours misses; if yours is higher, the triggering attack misses you, and you hit the attacker instead. If you hit it with a melee attack, the attack deals an extra damage die of the weapon's type, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Champion's Shield
Armor (shield), very rare

This round metal shield is magically covered with 1d4 designs of mighty foes, such as dragons, vampires, or krakens. While holding this shield, you have a +2 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. In addition, you gain 10 temporary hit points each time a creature within 120 feet of you uses a legendary action; these temporary hit points end early if you are no longer holding the shield. If a creature with legendary actions is slain within that range, a new etching depicting that creature's final moments appears amongst the other images. When a creature uses a legendary action to make an attack roll against you or force you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction while holding the shield to impose disadvantage on the attack roll or grant yourself advantage on the saving throw.

The shield is always under the effects of the programmed illusion spell, and its triggering condition is when you use an action to touch a foe's design on the shield and speak the item's command word. The scripted performance is of that creature's final minute, before it was slain, and the illusion appears in a 5-foot cube in front of the shield.

### Owl Helm
[TODO] this is a cute early item
Wondrous item, common

This helm is designed in the likeness of an owl. While wearing it, you can magically turn your head completely around to face behind you. If the helm is removed, your head returns to a normal position.

When you make an ability check to interact with an owl or related creature, such as a giant owl or owlbear, and are wearing this helm, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check. Once you do, this property of the helm can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Ring of Dagger Ice
Ring, very rare (requires attunement)

This dark silver ring is always cold to the touch. The gemstone set in it is made of dagger ice: a magical ice fragment from the Everglacier. While wearing the ring, you have resistance to cold damage.

Rays of Frost. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to cast the ray of frost spell from it, using a spell attack bonus of +8. This version of the spell creates four rays, instead of one. Each ray can target the same or different targets. Make a ranged spell attack for each ray; on a hit, the target suffers the effects of the ray of frost spell as normal. If two rays hit the same target, the target's speed is reduced by half, instead of 10 feet (whichever is greater). If all four rays hit the same target, its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.

### Remorhaz Cloak
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This cloak is made using a strip of a remorhaz's winglike fins and is lightly reinforced with plates of its spined carapace. The first time you attune to this item, and then again each day at dawn, you can choose either cold or fire damage: you gain resistance to that damage type until you make the choice again.

Fiery Carapace. While wearing the cloak, you can use an action to immediately gain 20 temporary hit points, which last for 1 hour. While you have these temporary hit points, any creature within 5 feet of you that hits you with a weapon attack automatically takes 2d6 fire damage, as flames erupt from your wounds. If a creature reduces these temporary hit points to 0, a wave of fire explodes from the cloak. Each creature within 10 feet of you, other than you, takes 2d6 fire damage from the explosion. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Boiling Blood. If you're a barbarian and are wearing this cloak, your blood boils whenever you rage. While you don't have the temporary hit points from the cloak's Fiery Carapace property, any creature within 5 feet of you automatically takes 1d4 fire damage whenever it hits you with a weapon attack while you're raging.

### War Pick of Corrosion
Weapon (war pick), very rare (requires attunement)

This weapon resembles the head of an ancient black dragon: its two horns curl behind its head to form the weapon's sharp pick. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d4 acid damage to any target it hits. This extra acid damage is doubled if the target is made of metal or is wearing metal armor.

The weapon has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with the war pick, you can expend 1 of its charges to increase the pick’s acid damage by 3d4, to a total of 4d4 extra acid damage, for that attack; this acid damage is still doubled if the target is made of metal or is wearing metal armor. If the target is wearing metal armor, it must also succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or the armor takes a cumulative −2 penalty to the AC it offers, to a minimum of 10 AC, which lasts until it finishes a short or long rest.

### Whalefall Armor
Armor (half plate), very rare (requires attunement)

This armor is made of repurposed whale bone and lashed together with salt-stained leather strips. While wearing it, you have resistance to poison damage and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. If you're underwater, you also have advantage on any Wisdom (Animal Handling) or Charisma check you make to interact with beasts that have a swimming speed.

Charges. The armor has 5 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Spells. While wearing this armor, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 16): false life (2nd-level version, 1 charge), insect plague (4 charges; the insects appear as a massive swarm of rotting quippers), or stinking cloud (2 charges).

Bakekujira. While wearing the armor, you can use an action to speak its command word and expend any number of charges from the armor, including 0, to summon the spirit of the whale used to make its bone plates. The spirit appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. It uses the statistics for a killer whale, except that it's undead, is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and has a flying speed equal to its swimming speed. It obeys your mental commands to the best of its ability (no action required by you), and takes its turn immediately after yours. If you don't issue any commands, the spirit defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. The spirit disappears in a cloud of marine snow after 1 minute. It disappears early if you use an action to dismiss it or if it's reduced to 0 hit points.

When the spirit disappears, roll a d10. If the result is equal to or less than 5 + the number of charges you expended as part of the action to summon it, it disappears as normal, and the property can't be used again until the next dawn. If the result is higher than that number, the spirit becomes hostile to you; it remains for 1 additional minute, can't be dismissed, and immediately regains half its maximum number of hit points. When this happens, this property of the armor can't be used again until 1d4 + 1 days have passed, during which time the number of charges the armor regains each day is reduced by half (rounded up).


### Armor of the Reef Warden
Armor (half plate or plate), very rare (requires attunement)


This armor is formed from living coral. While you're attuned to it, the armor magically opens and closes around you whenever you don or doff it, as if you were a welcome part of its ecosystem. As a result, doing so takes only an action, instead of multiple minutes. You also gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed while wearing the armor, and you can walk normally on any surface while underwater (such as on a wall or ceiling).

A thriving community of various spectral fish swim around the armor while you wear it, which duck in and out of its many crevices. You can call upon these fish for a variety of benefits. Once a fish has been used in this way, that fish can't be used again until the next dawn.

Barracuda. When you take the Dash action, you can make a single weapon attack as part of the same action, as a spectral barracuda helps propel your attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if you're underwater.

Moray Eel. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can cause a pair of eels to wrap around and grapple the target. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be grappled and restrained by the spectral eels for up to 1 minute. A grappled creature takes 1d8 force damage and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If the target is underwater, it has disadvantage on the saving throw.

Pufferfish. When you're hit by a melee attack or are grappled by another creature, you can use your reaction to cause a spectral pufferfish to inflate itself between you and the other creature. That creature takes 3d4 force damage from the fish's sharp spines, and you're immediately moved up to 5 feet away from that creature. If you're underwater, you move up to 15 feet instead. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if you were grappled, you escape from it.

Surgeonfish. You can use a bonus action on your turn to create a swirling school of spectral fish around you. The fish remain until the start of your next turn and grant any creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you half cover for the duration. If you're underwater, the fish grant three-quarters cover instead.

### Hand Mirror of the Medusa
Wondrous item, very rare

This hand mirror bears the bust of a medusa at its top. Its silver surface is split into thirds by a pair of metal fangs. While holding it, you have advantage on saving throws against becoming petrified, and any creature with the Petrifying Gaze trait that starts its turn within 30 feet of you must also succeed on a saving throw against its own Petrifying Gaze trait. A medusa has disadvantage on the saving throw.

Petrifying Cone. You can use an action to brandish the mirror in front of you and speak its command word. When you do, you expose it to each creature in a 30-foot cone that originates from you, provided that the creature can see you. Each creature in the area is immediately affected by the flesh to stone spell (save DC 16); you must concentrate on the spell as normal. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the mirror has been used to petrify a creature with its own Petrifying Gaze trait.

### Ringmaster's Top Hat
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

This colorful top hat carries a perpetual air of revelry and frivolity with it. While wearing the hat, you can use an action to cast the thaumaturgy spell from it, and you have proficiency with whips.

While wearing the hat, you can use an action to turn invisible, disappearing into a cloud of smoke when you do. The cloud heavily obscures the space you vanished from, and it remains there until the start of your next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. When you vanish in this way, you magically teleport to another space that you can see within 30 feet of you. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you make an attack or cast a spell. Once this property of the hat has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Crown of the Forgotten Circle
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a druid)

This flower crown is forever dried and wilted, and is filled with nettles and briars. While wearing it, you have resistance to necrotic and poison damage, and you always have the blight and spike growth spells prepared. These spells don't count against the total number of spells you can prepare each day.

As an action while wearing the crown, you can choose a point on the ground that you can see within 120 feet of you to cause a dense cluster of nettles to spring forth. The nettles grow in a 30-foot-radius circle, centered on that point, which last for 10 minutes before withering and turning to dust. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration for all creatures other than you. An affected creature that starts its turn in the nettles or enters them for the first time on its turn immediately takes 2d4 poison damage. If a creature takes 10 or more poison damage from the briars before the effect ends, that creature becomes poisoned for 1 hour. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Curse. This crown is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling and unable to remove the crown. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the number of hit points is reduced by 5 + the spell's level, as the crown's flowers try and fail to rejuvenate themselves with your magic.

### Mithral Beast Charms
[TODO] In the lower levels of Mithdral
Wondrous item, uncommon

These mithral charms resemble a type of woodland beast and can be easily worn on jewelry or carried by hand. You can use an action to touch a charm and speak its command word—typically the creature's name in Sylvan—to cause one or more of that creature to appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. Such a creature is considered to be fey, instead of beast, and is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands to the best of its ability (no action required by you), and takes its turn immediately after yours. A summoned creature remains for up to 10 minutes, but disappears early if you use an action to end the effect or if it's reduced to 0 hit points.

Once the charm has been used, it loses its magic and can't be used again. When found, the GM chooses the kind of charm it is or determines it randomly from the table below. When you summon a creature using the charm, you choose which beast it takes the form of, summoning the corresponding number of them.

Monkey, Bear, Boar, Deer(stag), Frog, Panther

### Sickle of the Sphinx
[TODO] make this have Finesse
Weapon (sickle), rare (requires attunement by a creature with an Intelligence score of 13 or higher)

The blade of this sickle is made of an azure crystal. Peering through the translucent blade conjures a flurry of existential questions to your mind. You gain a +1 bonus to any Intelligence check or Intelligence saving throw you make while attuned to the sickle. You're proficient with the sickle of the sphinx while you're attuned to it, and it deals an extra 1d4 psychic damage to any creature it hits.

While holding the sickle, you can use a bonus action to pose a mind-altering question (such as a riddle or philosophical prompt) to another creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you and understands at least one language. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage. This psychic damage increases by 1d4 each time you use this property against the same creature on a consecutive turn, to a maximum of 3d4 psychic damage.

### Cloudburst
Weapon (any bow), rare


This magic bow is weightless to hold. The shapes of its extending arms change ever so slightly while held, but always resemble a pair of stylized clouds, and a faint mist wraps around it. The normal range of cloudburst is 30 feet more than a typical bow of its type.

Whenever you use this bow to fire an arrow into water vapor, such as into a low-lying mist or fog cloud spell, the vapor immediately disappears from the area in a 10-foot-wide line, following the arrow's trajectory; fog can't reenter that space until the end of your next turn. Air elementals and other creatures made of clouds or mist take an extra 2d6 force damage from ranged attacks using the bow.

### Trap Sweeper
Wondrous item, uncommon

You can use an action to speak this broom's command word and sweep the ground with it. When you do, dirt and dust is kicked up by the broom in a 30-foot cone originating from it. The dirt and dust magically glows and clings to the edges of any trap, clearly outlining it for all to see. The trap remains outlined in this way for 1 minute.

Once the broom has been used to sweep for the third time in this way, it can't do so again until 1d4 − 1 days have passed. If you roll a 1 on the d4, the broom regains all uses of this property and can be used again immediately.

A trap, for the purpose of this item, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the item would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

### Staff of the Arcanum
Staff, legendary (requires attunement by a wizard)

This staff is made of both raw and polished obsidian. Your Intelligence and Wisdom scores each increase by 2, up to a maximum of 22, while you're attuned to it. In addition, you can use your Arcane Recovery twice between long rests, instead of once.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls. A target hit with the staff takes an extra 1d10 force damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from you.

Spell Storing. This staff stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The staff can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the staff by touching the staff as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the staff. If the staff can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While holding this staff, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the staff is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

Sentience. The staff of the arcanum is a sentient chaotic good staff with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 13. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The staff communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. While you're attuned to it, it also understands every language you know.

Personality. The staff of the arcanum is bookish and, at times, stuck up. It enjoys unraveling puzzles. It refuses to lend its strength to liches, however, preventing them and similar necromancers from using the staff's properties. At the GM's discretion, the staff may choose to cast a stored spell on its own (no action required by you).

### Lucky Horseshoes
Wondrous item, rare

Lucky horseshoes normally come in a set of four: one for each of a horse's hooves. Each one shines with a brilliant, brassy luster and has a single four-leaf clover at its center. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, the creature gains a +1 bonus to any ability check or saving throw it makes.

Luck. Each horseshoe has this property. When a creature wearing the shoes either misses with an attack roll or fails an ability check or saving throw, it can use its reaction to automatically hit or succeed on the roll instead. When this happens, one of the horseshoes immediately tarnishes and loses this property.

This effect can't allow the creature to do the impossible. For example, even with the aid of a lucky horseshoe, a horse can't succeed on an ability check in such a way that allows it to magically fly—doing that would require a set of horseshoes of a zephyr instead.

### Staff of the Cauldron Carrier
Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
This iron and brass staff holds a cauldron at its end. Despite its materials, it only weighs as much as a normal staff. While you're attuned to it, you gain a +1 bonus to any ability check using alchemy supplies, cook's utensils, or an herbalism kit.

Spells. The staff has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: burning hands (1 charge), create food and water (3 charges), detect poison and disease (1 charge), heat metal (2 charges), or purify food and drink (1 charge). This version of the create food and water spell grants 1d6 + 4 temporary hit points to any creature that consumes a meal that it creates. The food created by the spell is delicious.


### Halo Circlet
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This lustrous, gilded circlet hovers just above your head while worn. The inside of the circlet radiates with a golden glow, like a halo. While wearing it, you can speak, read, and write Celestial. In addition, you can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of your next turn. When you do, a pair of glimmering wings of golden light appear just behind your back for the duration.

While wearing the circlet, you can use your reaction to shroud yourself in celestial energy whenever you take fire damage, necrotic damage, or radiant damage from a hostile source. When you do, you have resistance to that damage type, including the triggering damage, until the start of your next turn. You also gain a secondary effect that depends on the type of damage dealt:
  
    Fire damage. The triggering fire damage is quartered, instead of halved.
     
    Necrotic damage. The first target you hit with an attack on your next turn takes an extra 2d10 necrotic damage from the attack.
     
    Radiant damage. You can use a bonus action to restore 2d8 hit points to a creature you touch on your next turn.

Divine Opposition. If you're a tiefling and are wearing the circlet, you can choose to deal radiant damage, instead of fire damage, whenever you would deal fire damage to a target. In addition, you can use a bonus action to release a wave of beautiful, discordant energy from the circlet. The wave affects up to 8 creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. You choose if an affected creature is either affected by the bless spell or is forced to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw; on a failed save, it's affected by the bane spell instead. These spells end at the start of your next turn, and any creature affected by them adds or subtracts 2d4 from its rolls, respectively, instead of 1d4. Once this bonus action has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.


### Amulet of the Platinum Fang
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)


A single fang—said to be from a deific dragon—hangs on this platinum necklace. The tooth itself is cracked but repaired with molten platinum, sealing it together and retaining its inherent magic. You have resistance to radiant damage while wearing this amulet. In addition, whenever a spell restores hit points to you, you also gain 1d6 + 4 temporary hit points.

Platinum Aspect. While wearing the amulet, you can use an action to call forth an instantaneous, spectral maw of a platinum dragon. Make a melee spell attack with the maw against a target within 15 feet of you, using a +10 spell attack bonus. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 + 10 force damage plus 4d6 radiant damage. Once you've used this property, you can't do so again until the next dawn.

If you're a dragonborn, you can choose to use this property in place of your breath weapon. When you do, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest, instead of the next dawn. If you use your normal breath weapon, you can choose for it to deal radiant damage, instead of its normal damage type.


### Crown of Season's Embrace
[TODO] Season themed, rework for nyari
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by an elf, half-elf, or fey)

This silver crown of tangled branches is dotted with tiny jewels, with a larger diamond resting at its center. While wearing the crown, you can change the shape of your ears using a bonus action. You also gain the elf's Trance racial trait if you don't already have it.

The crown has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn.

Spells. While wearing the crown, you can use an action to expend 4 of its charges to cast the dimension door spell; alternatively, you can use a bonus action to expend 2 charges to cast the misty step spell from it.

Season Change. When you first attune to the crown, and then again daily at dawn, you can choose a season for the crown to resonate with. When you do, the gemstones on the crown change color to match the respective season, and you gain resistance to the damage type associated with it. You can use a bonus action to expend 3 of the crown's charges to immediately change the associated season. Use the table below to determine what color and damage type is associated with each season.

Winter | Blue | Cold
Spring | Green | Radiant
Summer | Gold | Fire
Autumn | Orange | Necrotic


### Solacesteel Requiem
Weapon (pike), rare (requires attunement)

This weapon is made of sanctified mourningsteel. Whenever you hit a target with this weapon, roll an additional damage die and ignore the lowest result. If the target is undead, the weapon deals radiant damage, instead of piercing damage, and uses the total of all rolled damage dice.

In addition, while holding the pike, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to release an empowering wave of energy. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you (including yourself) immediately gains 1d10 + 10 temporary hit points. These hit points remain until the end of your next turn, during which time each affected creature has advantage on any attack roll or Wisdom saving throw it makes. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of this wave increases to 30 feet. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Crown of the Cursed King
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)

This tarnished crown was originally worn by a maddened king, whose hunger for power could seemingly not be stopped. Only with old age was his reign brought to an eventual end, at which time all symbols of his power were systematically destroyed, including this crown. However, his malevolent spirit remains in the form of magical strands of force that hold its pieces together—a lasting sign of his unwillingness to cede his rule.

The crown has the following properties.

Curse Bestowment. While wearing this crown, you can use an action to touch a creature and cast the bestow curse spell on it from the crown (save DC 16). If you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can cast the spell on that creature in this way (as if you were touching it) before the end of your next turn. You must be able to see the creature.

Curse Suppression. While wearing this crown, any curse affecting you is suppressed. For each suppressed curse, you gain a +1 bonus to any attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make (up to a maximum bonus of +3). Your attunement to a cursed magic item can't be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, even if its effects are suppressed by the crown. Curses from an artifact can't be suppressed in this way.

Rule of the Iron Fist. While attuned to the crown, your Strength and Charisma scores each increase by 2, up to a maximum of 22.

Curse. This crown is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. The effects of this curse aren't suppressed by the crown's Curse Suppression, but nevertheless contribute to the bonus you gain as part of that property. You are immune to the effects of remove curse while wearing the crown.

While cursed, you gain the following flaw: "I am always in danger of losing everything. I must ensure my legacy is preserved." In addition, you are unwilling to part with the crown, wearing it atop your head at all times. It can't be removed from your head against your will.


### Wand of Incense
[TODO] works nicely with the smoke cape
Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

This item is a magic incense holder sculpted in the design of a smoldering dragon. Its base is wrapped in leather and doubles as the handle of a wand. A stick of special, magic incense appears in the holder daily at dawn, which is held in place by the dragon's mouth and can't be removed until it's burned away. The special incense smells like heady brimstone and fills you with a sense of confidence. While a stick of incense is in the holder, it doubles as a wand.

The wand has 3 charges for the following properties. When the special incense reappears at dawn, so too do the wand's 3 charges; the incense only burns down when you expend the wand's charges, doing so proportionally to the number it has remaining. If any of the special incense is remaining when the new stick appears, it's replaced by the new one.

Spells. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using a spell attack bonus of +7: find familiar (form of a pseudodragon), fog cloud (the cloud is made of smoke), misty step, or scorching ray. If your attunement to the wand ends, the familiar is lost. When you cast misty step in this way, you leave behind and reappear in a cloud of smoke that heavily obscures both spaces until the start of your next turn.

Draconic Ward. While you can smell the burning incense, you can't be frightened by dragons. In addition, a dragon that smells the incense has disadvantage on any attack roll it makes against you.

If you have a normal stick of incense, you can use an action to place it in the empty holder. Normal incense burned in the holder never loses any of its total burn time, but is expelled from the holder when the special incense appears each dawn. Incense burned from the holder can be smelled by any creature within 60 feet of it. While holding the wand, you can choose whether or not the incense is burning (no action required).

### Hammer of Whispers
Weapon (light hammer), uncommon (requires attunement)

This dark silver hammer is miraculously light. It has the finesse property, and any target hit with it takes an extra 1d4 psychic damage. Hitting a target with the hammer produces no sound.

Curse. This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the hammer, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using this weapon, make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, your mind is plagued with mysterious whispers; you take 2d6 psychic damage and are incapacitated until the end of your next turn.

### Solacesteel Plate
[TODO] for Nyari
Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)

This gilded armor is made of purified mourningsteel and repels undead aggression. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on any saving throw against a hostile effect from an undead creature. In addition, you can use a bonus action to touch a creature with 0 hit points. When you do, the creature is stabilized.

If you're a cleric or paladin and are wearing this armor, immediately after an undead creature deals damage to you with a melee attack, it is automatically destroyed if its challenge rating is 1 or lower.


### Kobold Diviner's Amulet
[TODO] really cool kobold item
Wondrous item, uncommon

This necklace bears numerous rings and charms from its leather strap. The largest charm is a crystal ball, which is grasped by a draconic claw. While wearing the amulet, you can use an action to peer into its crystal ball and predict a number between 1 and 20. Then, roll a d20. If the result of the roll has a difference of no more than 2 from the predicted number, you magically foretell a sliver of future possibility. You then ask the GM one question about the events that will or can occur within the next 30 minutes, which must be able to be answered with either "yes," "no," or "uncertain." At the GM's discretion, the crystal ball may alternatively show you a visual answer. Once this property of the amulet has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. You must be able to speak Draconic in order to use this property.

For example, you use the amulet and predict the number 14. You then roll a 16 on the d20, allowing you to ask the GM a question, such as "Will the prison guards be attentive for the next half hour?" The GM may then describe a vision in the crystal of a guard sleeping beside their post, or simply say "no."

For the purposes of predicting a number on the d20, 19 and 20 are considered to have a difference of two from 1 and 2, respectively. Similarly, 20 and 1 are considered to have a difference of one.

### Cloth of Instant Tables
[TODO] good early reward
Wondrous item, common

This rolled up table cloth is secured by a wood-patterned ring. You can use an action to slide the cloth from the ring and flourish it—as if you're about to set a table with it. When you do, a wooden table magically appears on the ground beneath the cloth, provided that there's space for it. The table is 3 feet wide and 5 feet long; the cloth's ring is wrapped around one of its four legs, which can hold as much weight as a normal table's. The table is equipped with two attached benches, which can comfortably sit up to 6 Medium creatures.

The table remains until the cloth is removed from the table, which can be done using an action. As part of the action to remove the cloth and dismiss the table, you can roll it up and secure the cloth within the ring. If the table is destroyed, the cloth becomes a nonmagical table cloth.

### Sonar Arrow
Weapon (arrow), rare

This long, dark arrow looks as though it's been pierced through a bat. A target hit by this arrow takes an extra 2d10 thunder damage. Hit or miss, when the arrow first impacts with a creature, object, or other solid surface, it emits a brief, magical frequency, which is audible out to a range of 120 feet. Every creature that isn't deafened within the sound's range magically knows the location of every other physical creature and any obvious, uncovered object within the frequency's area at that moment. The arrow then loses its magic and becomes a normal arrow.

A creature that has the Keen Hearing trait gains a +5 bonus to any Wisdom (Perception) check it makes until the end of its next turn after hearing the frequency. If the arrow hits a creature with this trait, it takes an extra 3d10 thunder damage from the attack, instead of 2d10.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as sonar bolts meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.

### Blossoming Arrow
Weapon (arrow), rare

This twig-like arrow is fletched with split leaves and dotted with tiny blossoms. Its point is a complicated, bulb-like mass, which seems to cover a collection of strange glowing pustules at its center.

A creature hit by this arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison damage from the attack, or 3d6 if the creature is a plant, and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned for 1 hour. A poisoned creature gains the plant type, in addition to its other creature types, for as long as it remains poisoned. After the arrow deals this poison damage, it loses its magic.

Alternatively, if the arrow is planted or otherwise stuck in soil and left to rest for 30 days, it magically transforms into an awakened tree at the end of that time. This awakened tree is immune to poison damage and is covered in small, beautiful flowers. Until the arrow transforms into a tree in this way, you can remove it from the soil to use it as an arrow.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as blossoming bolts meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.

### Blazeblood Signet
Ring, very rare (requires attunement)

The gem at the center of this dark silver ring is always warm to the touch. While wearing the ring, your blood feels unnaturally hot, and it feels as though the ring itself pulses to match your heartbeat. You gain the following benefits while wearing this ring:
   
    You regain all of your spent Hit Dice whenever you finish a long rest.
     
    Whenever you spend Hit Dice to regain hit points at the end of a short rest, you automatically regain the maximum number of hit points possible.
     
    You can tolerate temperatures as low as −50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection. If you wear heavy clothes, you can tolerate temperatures as low as −100 degrees Fahrenheit.

Blood Conversion. While wearing this ring, you can choose to spend 1 or more Hit Dice whenever you hit a creature with an attack, up to a maximum of 5 Hit Dice per turn. For each Hit Die spent, roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You immediately gain temporary hit points equal to half the total (rounded up), and the target of the attack takes fire damage equal to the same amount.

Curse. This ring is cursed, and attuning to it extends the curse to you. For as long as you remain cursed, you regain half as many hit points whenever a spell or magical effect restores them.

### Chain Acolyte Robes
Armor (chain mail), rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

These acolyte robes are draped in heavy chain mail. You are proficient with this armor and ignore its Strength requirement if you have a spellcasting ability score of at least 13.

Spells. While wearing the armor, you can use an action to cast either the hold monster or hold person spell from the armor, using your spell save DC. When you do, the spell holds the target in place with magical chains; for the spell's duration, the target takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage from the chains at the start of each of its turns. Once you cast a spell in this way, that spell can't be cast from the armor again until the next dawn.

Wand of Binding. If you are also attuned to a wand of binding, it regains all expended charges daily at dawn. In addition, whenever you use the wand to cast hold monster or hold person, you can choose to have it cast the armor's version of the spell instead. You still use the wand's save DC when casting the spell in this way.

### Dart of Caltrops
Weapon (dart), uncommon

The tip of this all-metal dart resembles a single caltrop. If you hit a creature with a ranged attack using the dart, that creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until it regains at least 1 hit point (as if it had stepped on spread caltrops). Hit or miss, countless, magical caltrops burst from the dart to cover the ground in each space adjacent to the target. The caltrops remain for 1 minute, at which point they turn to dust and are destroyed.

Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the dart can still be used as a magic weapon.

### Molten Hammer
Weapon (maul), very rare (requires attunement)

This hammer is pulled like glass from molten rock and glows with residual heat from within. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to any target it hits.

Overheat. Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with this hammer, you can cause the hammer to magically overheat. When you do, the attack deals an extra 2d8 fire damage. You then take fire damage equal to half this amount, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way.

### Relentless Stinger
Weapon (rapier), rare

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic rapier. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using this weapon, the next target you hit with it before the end of your next turn takes an extra 10 piercing damage from the attack.


### Gloom Shield
Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)

This tall shield is made from the sculpted lid of a coffin. A skeletal figure rests embossed on its surface, reminding would-be attackers of their own mortality.

The shield has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dusk. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the fear spell from the shield (save DC 15). A creature that fails the saving throw also takes 4d6 psychic damage. Alternatively, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack while you're holding the shield, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the shield's charges to force that creature to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it immediately takes 4d6 psychic damage and is frightened of you for until the end of its next turn.

### Axe of Hurricanes
Weapon (any axe), uncommon

You can use an action to create a powerful whirlwind around you by swinging this magic weapon. Make a melee attack with the axe against each creature within 5 feet of you (other than yourself), with a separate attack roll for reach target. Immediately after the attacks, each creature within 15 feet of you (other than you) must also make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage. It takes a second 1d8 bludgeoning damage if it's within 10 feet of you, and a third 1d8 if it's within 5 feet. If the creature is Medium or smaller, it's also thrown up to 10 feet away from you. On a success, a creature takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't thrown.

Once this property of the axe has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Lunar Compass
Wondrous item, rare

This compass has a glass eye on its lid, allowing you to see it even while it's closed. At its center is a shallow moon sculpture, which is always magically shaded to match the current phase of the moon it represents. During the day, the item functions exactly like a normal compass.

While holding the compass between dusk and dawn, it emits dim light in a 5-foot radius. During this time, you can use an action to speak its command word, followed by the name of a specific fixed location on the same plane of existence as you. If you are outside and can see at least one moon, the needle then points in the direction of the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest one) to that location. This effect is suspended if you can no longer see the moon (such as if you enter a cave or dense forest), and it ends at dawn or when you're no longer holding the compass. Once you use this property of the compass, it can't be used again until the next dusk.

### Chapel Lantern
[TODO] cool flavor item for crypt adventure
Wondrous item, uncommon

This stained glass lantern casts colorful lights around it while lit, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Alternatively, you can fill the lantern with a flask of holy water. While holding it, you can use an action to magically reduce the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.

When the lantern is lit using holy water, the light that it sheds almost shimmers with divine magic. When lit in this way, any undead creature within the lantern's bright light has disadvantage on any attack roll it makes. Further, if such a creature starts its turn within the bright light, it immediately takes 1d6 radiant damage.

Each time that an undead creature takes radiant damage as result of the lantern's bright light, deduct 1 hour from the lantern's total burn time.

### Patch of the Open Eye
Wondrous item, common

This canvas patch can be magically attached to a piece of clothing by pressing it against the clothing for 1 minute. The patch remains on the clothing until it falls off or you use an action to remove it. While it's attached to a piece of clothing, the eye's pupil will occasionally dart off to the side before returning back to the center.

While the patch is attached to a piece of clothing you're wearing, you can't be surprised at the start of combat. Once the patch prevents you from being surprised in this way, it falls off. Alternatively, you can choose to peel off the patch as part of making a Wisdom (Perception) check. You make this decision after you roll the d20, but before knowing the result of the check. When you do, roll a d4 and add it to the total.

Once the patch has been removed from a piece of clothing it's attached to, the patch loses its magic and becomes a mundane patch. If the magic patch is removed from a robe of useful items, the patch has a 50 percent chance to keep its magical properties and can be reattached to a piece of clothing again.

### Gemini Mask
[TODO] this can probably be reworked to something cool for Ayra
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This half-mask remains securely on your face thanks to its full-width diadem, which extends from the mask around the rest of your brow. It functions as a hat of disguise. When you use an action to cast the disguise self spell from the mask, you can choose to appear identical to another creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. When you do, you can appear up to 3 feet shorter or taller to match the target's height.

Twin Sense. For the duration of this version of the spell, you gain the following benefits:
    
    You always know the general direction and distance of the other creature from you.
     
    When the other creature makes an attack against a target, you gain advantage on the first attack roll you make against the same target before the start of the other creature's next turn.
     
    You can use an action to see through the creature's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. If the creature is unwilling, it first makes an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, it's magically made aware of this effect—though not of you or its source—and the spell and effect ends. If a creature is immune to divination magic or is under the effects of a spell or magical effect that prevents such magic, you see and hear nothing from the creature's senses, and it automatically succeeds on the saving throw.
     
    The spell ends early if you're more than 1 mile away from the other creature.



### Ioun Blade
[TODO] cool dagger art usable for Mufi


### Rope Cobra
[TODO] cool early item
Wondrous item, common

You can use an action while holding this 30-foot length of hempen rope to speak its command word. The rope then magically animates and transforms (slightly) into a cobra made of rope. As part of this action, and then again as an action on each of your turns for the duration, you can issue the snake a verbal command, such as "tie yourself around that pillar." The snake only obeys the commands of the creature that animated it. The rope returns to normal and ceases to be animated after 1 minute, after it moves more than 120 feet, or when you use an action to speak its command word again; it can't be animated again until the next dawn.

The snake has 2 hit points, like normal rope, although it has resistance to all damage. It has AC 11 and a speed of 30 feet; it can climb walls and objects that aren't smooth at half its normal speed. The snake also has blindsight out to a range of 30 feet, is blind beyond that radius, can't attack, and has an escape DC of 10. If the rope is destroyed, whether it's animated or not, it becomes a normal length of nonmagical rope.

### Obsidian Star
[TODO] rework this a little bit as a anti mage + arcane trickster blade
Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement)

A favorite amongst mage hunters, this midnight-dark obsidian dagger sparkles like starlight. While in darkness, you can clearly see the cosmos in its blade. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If left outdoors under starlight for 8 hours, it automatically regains all expended charges at dawn instead.

When you hit a creature with the dagger, you can expend 1 of its charges to force the target to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes an extra 2d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If the creature is a spellcaster and fails the saving throw, it also can't cast spells of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level for 1 minute. It can make another DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns for the duration, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Whip of the Copper Eel
[TODO] probably cool if reworked

### Lightning Caltrops
Wondrous item, uncommon

These magic caltrops function like normal caltrops when scattered. When a creature takes lightning damage while standing on a space covered in these caltrops, that creature takes an extra 2d8 lightning damage. Once a creature in that space takes lightning damage in this way, or if the caltrops themselves are targeted by an effect that deals lightning damage, the caltrops become charged with electrical power. The caltrops remain charged for 1 minute or until a creature takes damage by stepping on them. Any creature that takes damage from stepping on the charged caltrops also takes an extra 2d8 lightning damage and can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. If a creature wearing metal armor steps on the charged caltrops and succeeds on the Dexterity saving throw, it still takes 1d8 lightning damage from the caltrops but does not end their charge.

If a set of lightning caltrops is scattered on the ground within 15 feet of another one, charging either set of caltrops also charges the other.

### Navis Anima
Wondrous item, legendary

A navis anima, or simply an anima, is a sentient gemstone that rests upon a magic pedestal. The gemstone can't be separated from the pedestal, despite the fact that the stone seems only loosely placed atop it. While the anima is on a vehicle, you can perform a ritual to name the gemstone and vehicle, magically binding the two together. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires a bottle of fine wine worth at least 100 gp. Once complete, the pedestal anchors itself to the vehicle and alters its appearance to match the vehicle's design. The chosen name then magically appears on the vehicle in a place of your choice, replacing any name that was already on it. A named anima cannot be renamed.

While an anima is bound to a vehicle, the vehicle is capable of travel at slow pace even if its usual source of movement isn't present. For example, a carriage bound to an anima could travel at a slow pace even without horses, as its wheels would magically rotate under the anima's control. The anima can make ability checks for the vehicle, using its vehicle's statistics, and it can grant any creature of its choice advantage on ability checks made to steer or otherwise control the vehicle, provided that the anima and chosen creature share at least one language. Conversely, any creature that attempts to control the vehicle against the anima's will has disadvantage on any ability check made to do so.

An anima can only be separated from its vehicle by the destruction of that vehicle. When this happens, the anima becomes dormant. It can be bound to a new vehicle by performing the naming ritual again, although it fails if you attempt to assign the gemstone a new name. The gemstone's name then appears on the new vehicle.

Sentience. A navis anima is a sentient magic item of any alignment. When the anima is first named, it begins with an Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma score of 10. Then, roll three d6s and add each result to a different one of those scores, recording each total as its new score for that attribute. The anima has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. It can see, hear, and feel anything as if it were in any space occupied by the bound vehicle.

The anima can speak and read Common and can communicate telepathically with creatures in physical contact with its vehicle. It can learn up to three additional languages; each new language requires it to travel for 30 days with a crew that primarily communicates using that language.

Personality. A navis anima is initially blank. Once it has been part of a naming ritual, however, it quickly forms a personality based on its given name, its bound vehicle, and its early interactions with other creatures. For example, a general's warship named the Lord's Blade may have an aggressive, militaristic personality, while a merchant's cart named the Timetable may be meticulous and punctual. However, all animas are protective of those they consider their crew and will prioritize their crew's interests over the interests of others.


### Weapon of Blind Faith
[TODO] cool feature for other weapons

### Scroll of Rugs
[TODO] make this something for early game, make creatures fall prone?

### Spatha of Martial Mastery
Weapon (shortsword), rare (requires attunement by a barbarian, fighter, monk, or rogue)

A long white ribbon trails behind this shimmering sword, whose blade is forged with swirls of gold. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, you gain the following benefits.

Cunning Strike. If you have 5 or more levels in the rogue class, you can use your Cunning Action feature to make a single attack with this weapon as a bonus action if you do not use an action to make a weapon attack or cast a spell on the same turn, as you master the balance of offense and improvisation.

Freed Hand. If you have 5 or more levels in the barbarian class, any target you hit with this weapon while raging takes an extra 1d6 piercing damage from it, as you master both brutal blows and the free exercise of your strength. You don't gain this benefit if you're holding a weapon or shield in your other hand.

Ki Channeling. If you have 5 or more levels in the monk class, you can use this weapon in place of any unarmed strike you make, as you master the grace and flow of your swordplay. Any feature that relies on or benefits your unarmed strikes, such as your Flurry of Blows or Martial Arts features, also applies to this weapon. In addition, whenever you use your Step of the Wind feature as a bonus action, you can immediately make one melee attack with the sword as part of that action.

Manipulating Attack. If you have 5 or more levels in the fighter class, you can take the Use an Object action or shove a target within your reach once per turn immediately after making an attack with this sword as part of the Attack action, as you master versatile tactics to shift the flow of battle. You can only push a target up to 5 feet away from you when you shove it in this way, but can choose to make the contested check using Dexterity (Acrobatics) instead of a Strength (Athletics) when you do.

### Unicorn Diadem
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)

A unicorn’s horn rests at the center of this diadem. While wearing the diadem, you can use it as a spellcasting focus, as if you were holding it. In addition, you have resistance to poison damage and have advantage on saving throws against poison. When you cast a spell while wearing the diadem, you can change the spell’s damage type for that casting to radiant damage, unless its normal damage type is necrotic.

While wearing the diadem, you can use an action to touch another creature and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. That creature then gains a +2 bonus to its AC until the start of your next turn and regains a number of hit points equal to 5 times the level of the spell slot you expended. If these hit points would cause that creature to exceed its hit point maximum, it gains half of those excess hit points as temporary hit points.

### Dragonwing Scimitars
Weapon (scimitar), legendary (requires attunement)

This pair of twin scimitars features draconic guards and winglike blades. Despite there being two weapons, they are considered to be a single item for the purposes of attuning to them. While holding one of the swords, you always know the general direction and distance of the other.

Chromatic Change. Each of the swords is associated with a damage type: either acid, cold, fire, lightning or poison. Any target hit by one of the scimitars takes an extra 1d10 damage of its associated type. While one of them is in your hand, you can use a bonus action to change its damage type to a different one. When you do, the color of its metal changes to reflect the new damage type.

Draconic Riposte. While holding each of the swords in either hand, you can use your reaction when you're hit by a melee attack to gain a +4 bonus to your AC against the triggering attack, potentially causing it to miss you. If the attack misses as a result of this reaction and the attacker is within 5 feet of you, you can immediately make an opportunity attack against the attacker using one of the scimitars.

Winged Rush. While you're holding the two swords in either hand, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed whenever you take the Dash action. You lose this speed at the end of your turn, falling if you are in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.

### Hagstone Amulets
Wondrous item, uncommon

A hagstone is a naturally occurring stone that's pockmarked with holes and crystalline veins. To be transformed into a magical hagstone amulet, it must be made by a hag. If a hag decides to give away one of these amulets, it always comes at a price.

On its own, a hagstone amulet does nothing. However, you can perform a 1-hour ritual to bind three or more amulets. If three or more bound hagstone amulets are worn by different creatures that are within 30 feet of one another, those creatures can use an action to cast either bestow curse or lightning bolt from their amulet (save DC 13). Alternatively, a creature can cast counterspell from the amulet as a reaction, using a spellcasting ability modifier of +3.

Once a spell has been cast from an amulet, that spell can't be cast again from it or any other hagstone amulet bound to it until the next dawn.

### Sahuagin Sabatons
Wondrous item, uncommon

A hagstone is a naturally occurring stone that's pockmarked with holes and crystalline veins. To be transformed into a magical hagstone amulet, it must be made by a hag. If a hag decides to give away one of these amulets, it always comes at a price.

On its own, a hagstone amulet does nothing. However, you can perform a 1-hour ritual to bind three or more amulets. If three or more bound hagstone amulets are worn by different creatures that are within 30 feet of one another, those creatures can use an action to cast either bestow curse or lightning bolt from their amulet (save DC 13). Alternatively, a creature can cast counterspell from the amulet as a reaction, using a spellcasting ability modifier of +3.

Once a spell has been cast from an amulet, that spell can't be cast again from it or any other hagstone amulet bound to it until the next dawn.

### Wand of the Plagueswarm
Wand, very rare (requires attunement)

This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand dissolves into a fetid slime that sizzles and evaporates, destroying the wand and leaving behind a stain that can never be cleaned.

Spells. While holding the wand, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 16): bestow curse (1 charge), blight (2 charges), conjure animals (1 charge; summons two giant toads or four giant frogs), contagion (3 charges), darkness (1 charge), harm (4 charges), ice storm (2 charges), or insect plague (3 charges). These versions of the bestow curse and contagion spells have a range of 30 feet, instead of touch.

Endless Plagues. Whenever your concentration ends on a spell that you cast from the wand, you can immediately use your reaction to cast a different spell from it that also requires concentration, provided you're still holding the wand. You must expend the respective number of charges to cast the spell, as normal.

Curse. This curse is only revealed if the wand is destroyed as a result of expending its last charge, extending the curse to you when that happens. You can end your attunement to this wand as normal, even though it's cursed. While you're cursed, you are also diseased. Only a wish spell can end this curse and disease. While diseased, you have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws, and you must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence check whenever you attempt to use a magic item property. On a failed save, your action to use the item is wasted. For example, casting a spell from a wand would be considered as using one of its properties, but attacking with a +1 longsword wouldn't.

### Adrenal Blades
[TODO] maybe cool for Kazimir
Weapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)

This pair of scimitars are made of darkened steel and have feather-like designs. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons, which are considered to be a single item for the purposes of attuning to them. While holding one of the swords, you always know the general direction and distance of the other. While the swords are on your person, choose one of the following benefits whenever you roll initiative. These benefits last for 1 minute.

Fight. The weapons' bonus increases to +3, instead of +1. You have advantage on opportunity attacks made with them.

Flight. You gain a flying speed of 40 feet, but fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft. Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

In addition, if a creature forces you to make a saving throw against becoming frightened, you can immediately use your reaction (before making the saving throw) to move up to your speed in a straight line toward that creature. If the target is within 5 feet of you at the end of this movement, you can also make two weapon attacks against it: one with each scimitar. For each attack that hits, you gain a +5 bonus to the saving throw against becoming frightened.

### Wand of Entombment
Wand, very rare (requires attunement)

This wand's bone handle is connected to a large coffin nail by a rigid chain. The wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

Detect Undead. You can use an action to hold the wand out in front of you and expend 1 of its charges. When you do, the wand's chain goes slack, and remains slack for 1 hour or until you end the effect using a bonus action. For the duration, the nail magically levitates and points in the direction of the nearest undead creature within 120 feet of you. If you use any of the wand's other properties while its chain is slack, it snaps back to normal for as long as it takes to use that property.

Disintegrate. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 4 of its charges to cast the disintegrate spell from it (save DC 15).

Entombing Nail. While holding the wand, you can use an action to send out two nails of pure necrotic energy, targeting a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack for each nail against the target, using a spell attack bonus of +7. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 necrotic damage, and its speed is reduced by 5 feet for 1 minute. If this attack reduces a creature's speed to 0 feet, it can't speak for the duration. An affected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns; on a success, the effects of any nail on it ends. You can send out additional nails by expending 1 or more charges as part of using this property, sending out one additional nail for each charge you expend. This penalty to speed is cumulative.

### Freezing Gauntlets
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

When not worn, these gauntlets appear to be simple iron cuffs. Once worn, however, creeping plates of crystalline ice form from beneath the metal to encase your arms and hands in icy gauntlets. While wearing the gauntlets, you have resistance to cold damage, and any target you hit with them as part of an unarmed strike takes an extra 1d4 cold damage. Alternatively, frost creeps up the metal of any weapon you're holding. If you hit a target with a metal weapon, that target also takes an extra 1d4 cold damage from the attack.

Cone of Cold. While wearing the gauntlets, you can use an action to hold your hands out and cast the cone of cold spell from them (save DC 16). Whenever you cast the spell in this way, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance that this version of the spell permanently changes. When it does, the version of cone of cold cast by the gauntlets deals half as much damage, the size of its cone is halved, and once it's cast from the gauntlets, it can't be cast from them again until the next dawn.


### Spellforge Scabbard
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This teal leather scabbard is decorated with mithral emblems. While wearing it, you can use a bonus action to drag a weapon across the scabbard. For the next minute, the weapon glows with a faint blue aura, and you can use a bonus action to magically return that weapon to the scabbard, stowing it there. If the weapon was nonmagical, it also becomes magic and has a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls for the duration. The effect ends early if you use this property again.

The scabbard can magically hold any one weapon at a time, shunting the weapon into an extradimensional space while leaving its handle or similar end exposed and within your reach. Regardless of the weapon it's holding, the scabbard always weighs 2 pounds. Any sheathed weapon falls to the ground at your feet if your attunement to the scabbard ends or if you sheath a second weapon in it.

The scabbard has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you use the scabbard to grant a weapon a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls, you can choose to expend 1 of its charges to increase that weapon's bonus to +2 for the duration instead.

Alternatively, you can use an action to expend 1 of the scabbard's charges to draw any type of melee weapon out of the scabbard. The drawn weapon is spectral, remains for 1 minute, and has a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls. Any attack that hits with it deals force damage, instead of its normal damage type. You can use a bonus action to return the spectral weapon to the scabbard, and if the weapon would normally have the heavy property, it doesn't.

### Crossbow of the Flying Fist
Weapon (crossbow, hand), uncommon (requires attunement)

The front of this weapon is carved in the likeness of a wooden fist. Crossbow bolts fired from this weapon deal either bludgeoning or piercing damage on a hit (your choice). If you deal bludgeoning damage to a target in this way, the crossbow bolt impacts the target without piercing it, leaving only a sizable welt or bruise behind. When this happens, you can also choose to have a mage hand appear at the target's location, as if you had cast the spell, provided the target was within 30 feet of you. You can use a bonus action immediately after the attack to control the hand.

This version of the mage hand spell can be used to punch a target within 5 feet of it whenever you control it, using a spell attack bonus of +5. On a hit, the hand deals 1 force damage.

### Incendiary Caltrops
Wondrous item, uncommon

These caltrops contain a magical heat source at their center. A set of incendiary caltrops comes with 1d6 + 6 magic caltrops when found. You can use an action to throw any number of these caltrops in an unoccupied 5-foot square on the ground that you can see within 15 feet of you. When you do, roll a number of d4s equal to the number of caltrops thrown and record the total. When a creature steps into that space, it must immediately make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. The caltrops then explode, and that creature takes an amount of fire damage equal to the total rolled on the d4s on a failed save, or half as much fire damage on a successful one. Once a caltrop has dealt this fire damage, it becomes a nonmagical caltrop.


### Time Warden Armor
Armor (breastplate), very rare (requires attunement)

This silver and brass breastplate is adorned with subtle clock designs. While wearing this armor, you are immune to the slow spell and don’t suffer the negative effects of haste when it ends on you.

When you roll initiative while wearing this armor, use the number rolled on the d20, before adding any modifiers, to determine which of the following effects occur:
1-5 | Any attack roll made against yo ubefore the start of your second turn of combat is made with Disadvantage.
6-15 | You add 1d12 to the total of your initiative.
16-20 | At the start of your first turn, you can use a Bonus Action to take the Dash action. If you take the Attack action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that Attack action. You make this additional attack roll with advantage.
