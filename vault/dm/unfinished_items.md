### Toadstool Mace
mace, rare, attunement

This mace is made in the likeness of a toadstool. It releases a gentle plume of glimmering spores when swung. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you hit a creature with this weapon and roll a 6 on the weapon's damage die, roll a d4 and consult the table below. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be subjected to an effect based on the number rolled on the d4. A creature that doesn't need to breathe automatically succeeds on the saving throw.


### Lazar's Magic Eye
wondrous item, rare, attunement by a creature missing an eye
You can use this magic item as a replacement for a missing eye, even if you're not attuned to it. While it's in your eye socket, it can’t be removed by anyone other than you, and you can see through the item as though it were a normal eye. While it's in your eye socket and you're attuned to it, you can use an action to activate one of its two properties. Once a property has been used, that property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Lazar's Beam. You glare at a target that you can see within 120 feet of you. When you do, the eye charges up and releases a beam of concentrated flame at the target. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. For every 6 rolled on the damage dice, the resulting explosion deals 6 fire damage to other creatures within a cumulative 5 feet of the target, up to a maximum of 30 fire damage. For example, if you rolled three 6s on the fire damage dice, each other creature within 15 feet of the target would also take 18 damage.

Lazar's Sight. You gain truesight out to a range of 120 feet for 10 minutes. For the duration, you can also tell the radiant temperature of targets you use an action to inspect.


### Mighty Falconer's Mitt
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

This oversized glove can be worn over an existing gauntlet or similar hand covering. It has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can use an action to expend 1 of the glove's charges to summon a spectral falcon to your outstretched, gloved hand. When you do, choose one of the following two options:

Scout. The falcon immediately flies up to 60 feet and becomes invisible (like a scrying sensor). Until the end of your turn, you can choose to see through the falcon's eyes, instead of your own, using its senses. The effect then ends.

Strike. The falcon streaks from your hand in an ethereal blur, extending from you in a 60-foot line that's 5 feet wide. Each creature within that line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d4 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A hostile creature that's in the line and within 5 feet of at least one of your allies makes the saving throw with disadvantage.

### Bag of Forging Coals
Wondrous item, uncommon

When found, this leather bag is filled with 1d6 + 2 smoldering coals. They remain hot within the bag, keeping it warm to the touch on the outside. When a coal is placed in a fire, such as a campfire or forge, the fire remains at its optimal temperature (based on its original intended use) for the next 8 hours without having to add any additional fuel to it. At the end of the 8 hours or when the coal is removed from the fire, roll a d4: on a 1, the coal sputters out and ceases to be magical. A creature that finishes a short or long rest within 15 feet of such a fire gains 2d4 temporary hit points.

Alternatively, you can use an action to drag a coal across a nonmagical weapon. For the next 8 hours, that weapon deals an extra 1d4 fire damage to any target it hits. When you use the coal in this way, it then ceases to be magical.

### Waterwine Goblet
Wondrous item, common

This glass goblet has a colored tint to the outside, which undulates around the glass. Flicking the glass with your finger using an action causes the color to alternate between deep red, pink, and a light golden color. Water that's drunk from the glass tastes like a fine wine that corresponds to the glass's color: red, rosé, or white, respectively.

I love hydrating with wine.
### Comet Dart
Weapon (dart), uncommon

This five-pointed dart is decorated with pieces of ever-frozen ice. When thrown, a streak of shimmering icy dust trails behind it. A target hit by the dart takes an extra 3d4 cold damage; it then takes 1d4 cold damage again at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. The effect ends early if the target takes any fire damage or it uses an action to fall prone and roll on the ground. Whenever you roll a 4 on the cold damage dealt in this way, the target's speed is reduced by a cumulative 10 feet; this effect can't reduce a creature's speed below 10 feet. This penalty lasts for 10 minutes or until the target takes any fire damage.

Once the dart hits a target, this property ceases to function until the next dawn. Until then, a target hit by the dart takes an extra 1d4 cold damage, but doesn't suffer any penalties to its speed.

Even the boldest learn that haste can falter beneath the weight of the stars.
### Ring of Silverware
Ring, common

While wearing this ring, you can use a bonus action to mentally command the ring to transform into a fork, spoon, or other harmless element of a set of cook's utensils (such as a ladle or spatula). The transformed ring returns to its normal form on your finger if you mentally end the effect (no action required) or are no longer holding it.

Every food is finger food.
### Iron Rose
Weapon (morningstar), rare (requires attunement)

The head of this morningstar is in the shape of a rose. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The weapon has two forms: bloom form (if the weapon is in bright light) or bud form (if the weapon is in dim light or darkness). Iron petals unfurl from the weapon's spiked head while in bloom form, and enclose it while in bud form. While in bud form, the weapon deals bludgeoning damage, instead of piercing.

While holding the weapon, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (spell save DC 15): entangle (bud form only), protection from poison (any form), or spike growth (bloom form only). Once a spell has been cast from the weapon, it can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.

A rose without its thorns is beauty without pain, love without loss, or a hero without a villain: to know both is what makes it special.

### Greatstone's Grasp
Weapon (greatclub), rare

This stone greatclub is made from the arm and hand of a hulking earth elemental. Its titanic fist opens and closes. When you hit a creature with the club and roll an even number on the damage die, the fist closes on the target: the target of the attack must then succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be grappled by the fist. The fist can only grapple one creature at a time; a creature that is at least one size larger than you automatically succeeds on the saving throw against it. You can release a held creature at any time (no action required); letting go of the club releases any creature grappled by it. While holding the grappling club, your speed is halved (moving the held creature with you), and you can't attack with it. Instead, you can forgo making an attack with the club to push a grappled creature up to 10 feet away from you. A grappled creature can use an action on its turn to make the Strength saving throw again, escaping from the grapple on a success.

The earth remembers, and it doesn't let go.


### Rejuvenating Bandage
Wondrous item, uncommon

You can wrap this bandage around a willing creature's wounds over the course of 1 minute. The next time a creature finishes a short rest while wrapped with the bandage, it regains 3d8 + 3 hit points. If you have a severed body part and bandage it to the matching creature's stump, the bandage also causes the limb to magically knit to the stump at the end of the rest. Either way, the bandage then loses its magic and falls from the wound.

"So you're sure that herding axe beaks is… safe, right?"

"Of course! And, if it does go bad, we'll just put you back together again."


### Snow Silver
Wondrous item, uncommon

This silver coin is ornamented with snowflake designs. It's always cold to the touch, and it can magically cool up to 1 pint of liquid it's placed in over the course of 6 seconds.

If the coin is on your person when you take cold damage, the damage is halved, and the coin frosts over. This property of the coin then ceases to function until the next dawn, at which point the coin defrosts.


### Slippers of the Rat
Wondrous item, uncommon

While wearing these slippers, ordinary rats (including giant rats and swarms of rats) are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. Furthermore, you can use a bonus action to speak the slippers' command word to transform into a rat (as if by the polymorph spell) until the end of your next turn; your alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are unchanged for the duration of the spell. You return to your normal form early if you drop to 0 hit points or if you choose to end the effect (no action required). If there isn't enough space for you to return to your normal form, you immediately take 1d10 force damage and are magically returned to the nearest unoccupied space from which you came. This property of the slippers can be used twice, and they regain any expended uses daily at dawn.

  
Squeak squeak, sneak sneak


### Bottled Talent
Elixir, uncommon

When you drink this potion, you gain proficiency with one skill, saving throw, or tool of your choice for 24 hours. The glowing potion has a glimmering swirl at its center.

"Hey, are you sure you can do this? I've never seen you dance before."
"Of course I can. Hold my helmet."


### Bag of Irresistible Leaves
Wondrous item, uncommon

This small bag sounds like it's filled with an impossible number of crunchy, fallen leaves. You can use an action to open the bag and upend it on the ground into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. A pile of leaves then falls from the bag, filling a 5-foot cube in that space. A creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the leaves and can see them must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to leap into the pile until the end of the turn. The compelled creature must use its movement to reach and leap into the pile, taking the Dash action if necessary, and remain in that space for the rest of the turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw or is no longer compelled by the pile of leaves is immune to the effect for the next 24 hours. A creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw if it can't be charmed or if moving to the leaves would be directly harmful to it.

The pile of leaves dissipates after 1 hour. It dissipates early if a creature leaps into it or if it's blown away by a moderate wind of 10 miles per hour or greater. The bag can hold enough leaves to make 3 piles, and it regains enough leaves for 1d3 new ones daily at dawn.

It's truly impossible to leaf it alone.

## Mirage Leathers
Armor (leather), uncommon (requires attunement)

This stark white armor tricks the eye in strong light, like a mirage. While wearing this armor, other creatures take a −5 penalty to any Wisdom (Perception) checks they make to see you, provided you're in bright light or sunlight. In addition, you can use an action to cast the mirror image spell. This version of the spell ends early if you start your turn without being in bright light or sunlight. For the duration of the spell, you can take the Hide action as a bonus action, and remain hidden, even if you're in plain sight. Once the armor has been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

### Medium's Rod
Rod, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

While holding this rod, ghosts and similar incorporeal creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you can't become possessed. The rod has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dusk.

Cursing Flames. You can use an action while holding the rod to expend 1 or more of its charges to hurl ghostly flames at a target within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack for each expended charge, using your spell attack bonus; each attack can be against the same target or different ones. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 fire damage and is cursed for 1 minute. While cursed, the target can't benefit from being invisible, and you can use an action to automatically deal 1d4 fire damage to it for each flame it's cursed by. The curse ends early if the target is ever more than 60 feet away from you. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points while it's cursed, the curse ends, and you regain 1 charge for each flame it was cursed by. The fire damage dice become d6s and deal radiant damage if the target is undead.

See Invisibility. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the see invisibility spell from it. For the duration of the spell, you have advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with undead.


"Spirits! You needn't suffer the realms beyond: come forth, and be at peace at last. Begone!"

### Mycelial Staff
Staff, uncommon

This staff is made of a cluster of bioluminscent mushrooms atop a mycelial column. While holding it, it emits dim light in a 10-foot radius. You can use an action while holding the staff to plant it in the ground at your feet, sending out a magical network of branching, mycelial roots in a 60-foot-radius circle, centered on the staff and spreading around corners. The roots remain for 1 minute or until you move or are no longer holding the staff. For the duration, you and any other creature touching the staff gains tremorsense within the roots' area, out to a range of 60 feet. A creature that has this tremorsense has advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) check it makes to detect a creature within the area, and can make the check as if it were in any space within the roots' area. Once this property of the staff has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.


"So how did you know about the hidden basement?"

"Oh, I have an extensive underground network."

### Scorpion Glaive
Weapon (glaive), uncommon

This glaive is gently curved. It magically straightens when you thrust it forward. On a hit, the weapon deals either piercing or slashing damage (your choice each time). When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a creature, that creature must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature takes 1d6 poison damage at the start of each of its turns; it can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns for the duration, ending the effect on a success.


### Ballista Pike
Weapon (glaive), uncommon

This glaive is gently curved. It magically straightens when you thrust it forward. On a hit, the weapon deals either piercing or slashing damage (your choice each time). When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a creature, that creature must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature takes 1d6 poison damage at the start of each of its turns; it can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns for the duration, ending the effect on a success.


### Gibbering Candle
Wondrous item, uncommon

This oozing, red wax candle provides the same light as a normal candle. Twisted faces contort ever worse as the candle melts. A creature within the candle's light hears a telepathic and incoherent babbling, which gets louder as you near the candle. When a creature that can see the candle enters the candle's light for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of its next turn; a creature makes this saving throw with disadvantage if it's within the candle's bright light. A creature incapacitated in this way can only move toward the candle for the rest of the turn. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the candle or anything within its light until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the candle or something within its light in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 1 hour, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 10 minutes from the candle's total burn time.

### Pickpocket's Pouch
Wondrous item, uncommon

This black leather bag sits on your hip to provide easy access when depositing handheld items. It opens and closes silently, and it can stretch to fit about 1 cubic foot of space. You gain a +1 bonus to Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made while wearing this bag. Objects in the bag can't be detected or seen by divination magic, such as by the scrying spell or locate object.

The bag has a latch that can be opened in one of two ways. Opening it the first way reveals the inside of the bag as normal. Opening it the second way causes an illusion to appear over the objects in the bag; the illusion is of five loose copper pieces, a quill and ink, and a waterskin. To discern that the contents are an illusion, a creature can use its action to inspect the pouch and must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The illusion also fails to hold up to physical inspection.

A bit o' misdirection, a flick o' the wrist, and what was thine is now mine.


### Death Brand
Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement)

This magic dagger teleports back to your hand immediately after you make a ranged attack with it. The dagger has 4 charges, and it regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

When you hit a creature with this dagger, you can expend 1 of the weapon's charges to mark it for death: you sense the general direction of a marked creature's location, as long as it remains within 1,000 feet of you. If the marked creature is within 60 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to teleport to a random unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature and immediately make an attack against it using the dagger. The attack roll is made with advantage. If the target is more than 60 feet away from you or if there are no unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of it, nothing happens, and the action is wasted.

A mark lasts for 10 minutes. The mark ends early if you mark another creature, if you're ever more than 1,000 feet away from it, or if you use the dagger to teleport (even if it fails).

Now run. I love a good chase.


### Crack of Thunder
Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement)

While holding this sword, you have resistance to lightning damage. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.

Energy Surge. Before you make an attack with this weapon, you can cause it to split apart into a group of bladed segments. The segments are suspended in the air and are held together by a powerful electrical force. The reach of your attack is increased by 15 feet, and any target you hit with it takes an extra 2d6 lightning damage from the attack, instead of 1d6. Hit or miss, cracks of thunder erupt from the point of impact. Each creature within 10 feet of the target (other than you) must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 thunder damage. If you hit the target with the attack, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage. The weapon then returns to its normal form. This property of the weapon can't be used again until 8 hours have passed or until 10 or more lightning damage is dealt to you (before applying resistance or immunity).

Lightning Rod. Whenever a creature within 40 feet of you takes lightning damage, you can use your reaction to take some or all of that lightning damage instead. When you do, electricity arcs from the other creature to you. You choose how much lightning damage to reduce the triggering effect by; you then take that amount of lightning damage instead.

### Mistwalkers
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

Your walking speed is increased by 10 feet while wearing these boots. While in fog, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed; you move through the air as if you're walking.

Once on each of your turns when you walk 30 or more feet on the ground in a straight line, you can immediately cast the misty step spell from the boots (no action required). When you do, you teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you that's along the same straight line and in the same direction in which you were moving. This property of the boots can be used four times. The boots regain one use of this property for every hour they aren't used to teleport

### Swallowtail Mantle
Wondrous item, rare

While wearing this mantle, when you move 10 or more feet before jumping, the maximum distance of your jump is increased by 10 feet. In addition, when you fall at least 20 feet while wearing this mantle, you can use your reaction to grip its edges with both hands. While holding the edges, you fly at a speed of 30 feet, but cannot fly upwards without a significant updraft. Unless you're lifted by an updraft, you descend 15 feet at the end of each of your turns. If you land on the ground while flying in this way, you take no damage from falling. You lose this flying speed if you ever fail to grip the mantle's edges.

### Healer's Voice
Wondrous item, rare

This silver and gold necklace hums with a healing energy when you speak certain arcane words. Whenever you cast the healing word or mass healing word spell, you can grant one target of the spell 4 temporary hit points for each d4 that rolled a 4. If you roll a 1 on a d4, you can reroll the die. You must use the new roll.

In addition, whenever you make an ability check to calm, heal, or otherwise soothe another creature, you can roll a d4 and add it to the total. Once this property of the necklace has been used, it can't be used again until you or another creature has cast healing word or mass healing word while wearing the necklace.

### Ring of Salt
Ring, rare

This clear ring is made of crystalline salt. Donning or removing the ring requires an action. While wearing this ring, ghosts can neither move through nor possess you. If a ghost is already in your space or possessing you when you put on the ring of salt, it's forcibly ejected from you to the nearest unoccupied space and takes 1d10 force damage. Furthermore, the first time on each of your turns when you move through a ghost's space, that ghost must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be pushed to the nearest unoccupied space and take 1d10 force damage. Each time a ghost is forcibly ejected or pushed by the ring, the ring has a 10 percent chance of being destroyed and crumbling into a negligible pile of salt.

### Ring of Vitality
Ring, rare (requires attunement)

While wearing this ring, your hit point maximum increases by 10, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced by any means short of a wish spell.

### Celestial Bident
Weapon (trident), legendary (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)

This bident's prongs are designed as celestial wings. A ball of pure light radiates between the wings, which sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight. While holding the bident, you can use a bonus action to light or extinguish the ball. Alternatively, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 40 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each. If you're attuned to the celestial bident, you are considered proficient with it.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage to any target it hits while the ball of pure light is present in the bident. Immediately after you make a ranged weapon attack with the bident, it flies back to your open hand. While holding the weapon, you also gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.

Bestow Light. While the ball of light is present between the bident's prongs, you can use an action to touch a creature with the bident and confer the light into them. The ball disappears within the creature for 8 hours. For the duration, the creature can't be blinded, deafened, diseased, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned. If the creature is already affected by such a condition, the effects are suppressed for the duration of this effect. The ball of light returns to the bident at the end of the 8 hours or when the creature is reduced to 0 hit points. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, the ball lifts from the creature's body and returns to the bident, and the creature immediately regains 1 hit point. Once a creature has benefitted from this property, it can't do so again for 24 hours.

Guiding Bident. While holding the weapon, you can use an action to cast the guiding bolt spell from it, using your spell attack bonus. When you do, the bolt appears as a duplicate of the bident made of pure light, and on a hit, any allied creature within 10 feet of the target gains 10 temporary hit points.


### Pauldron of the Lost Legion
[TODO] Rework this for something the elves of cormanthyr had, the artwork is cool
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)

This pauldron is made of mourningsteel, a metal sometimes found below ancient battlegrounds. A tattered capelet bearing a crest hangs from it.

You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this pauldron. In addition, whenever you roll initiative and aren't surprised, you can immediately move up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, provided your speed isn't 0. While moving in this way, you can move through another creature's space, regardless of its size, and such a creature's space isn't considered difficult terrain for you. Your appearance becomes slightly ghost-like for the duration of this movement; you can force one creature you move through in this way to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 force damage on a failed save. While wearing the pauldron, you also have advantage on saving throws against effects from undead.

The pauldron has the spirits of 10 long-lost souls trapped within its metal. While wearing it, you can use the pauldron's following properties by calling upon the trapped souls; these properties use a spell attack bonus of +9 and spell save DC of 17. The pauldron regains the use of 1d8 + 2 spirits daily at dawn.

Spells. You can use an action to cast either the guardian of faith (4 spirits) or spirit guardians (3 spirits) spell from the pauldron. The spells appear as a ghostly formation of stalwart soldiers or a swirling whirlwind of weaponry, respectively.

Retaliate. When you take damage from another creature you can see within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to use 1 of the pauldron's spirits to make a melee spell attack against the triggering creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 4 force damage, and you gain 10 temporary hit points.

Spirit Swarm. As an action, you can use 3 or more spirits from the pauldron to create a formation of ghostly soldiers. The soldiers appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. Treat the soldiers as a Large undead swarm: they can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and they can move through any opening as small as 1-inch across. The swarm has 10 hit points for every spirit used to create it, and it can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points. It has immunity to all damage and effects, but loses 10 hit points at the end of each of your subsequent turns. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to move the swarm up to 30 feet and make a melee spell attack against a creature in its space. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 + 4 force damage, or half as much damage if the swarm has fewer than half its hit points remaining. The swarm vanishes once it reaches 0 hit points. It vanishes early if you dismiss it (no action required) or if it's targeted by the dispel evil and good spell or similar magic.

Sentience. The pauldron of the lost legion is a sentient lawful good item with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 17. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The pauldron communicates telepathatically with its wearer and can speak, read, and understand Common. The pauldron's voice is cacophonous and echoing in your mind.

Personality. The pauldron of the lost legion's sentience is divided between the 10 spirits trapped inside, which were all a part of the same battalion long ago. Even once a spirit is used as part of one of the pauldron's properties, it returns to the item and can still be heard among their voices. The dominant personality of the pauldron is that of the battalion's leader, a gruff and tired man named Elrik Viccar. He is followed for eternity by his fellow soldiers, despite his wishes for them to pass on. Elrik is plagued with guilt and is certain that his actions led to his comrades' undeserved deaths.

Purifying the Pauldron. Unburdening Elrik of his guilt (which can be done at the GM's discretion) causes the pauldron to become purified, transforming it into a gold-hued metal called solacesteel when it happens. The solacesteel version of this item isn't sentient, but the spirits' spell attacks use a d8 damage die, instead of a d6.


### Verdant Breastplate
Armor (breastplate), rare (requires attunement)

When found, this breastplate resembles a leather cuirass covered in large, dried leaves. Once you wear and attune to it, however, it springs to life and flourishes; its leaves remain pliable and flexible, but harden against incoming harm to protect you. Sleeping in this armor has no adverse effect on you.

While wearing this armor, moving through nonmagical plants that impede movement (such as by creating difficult terrain) costs you no extra movement, and you don't take damage from nonmagical plant hazards such as thorns or spines. In addition, the entangle spell has no effect on you, and you have advantage on any Dexterity (Stealth) check you make to hide in areas of dense foliage.

Charges. This armor has 7 charges and regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you're a druid or ranger and have cast the plant growth spell from the armor within the last 24 hours, the armor regains all expended charges instead.

Spells. While wearing this armor, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast either the entangle (1 charges) or plant growth (3 charges) spell from it, using a spell save DC of 15. If you're a druid or ranger, you can choose to cast the spell from the armor using your spell save DC instead.

When you cast plant growth using this armor, the plants affected by the spell are enriched for 30 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

### Fireamber scepter
Rod, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

A fire beetle has been preserved within the amber of this otherwise twisted wooden rod. While holding it, you can use an action to cast the dancing lights spell from it. When you do, the light is warm and fiery, and at the center of each glowing orb is an illusory, ghostly fire beetle; the glowing orbs can be combined to form a beetle-like shape. Alternatively, while you're holding the scepter, you can cause its amber head to glow, shedding warm bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The scepter continues to glow until you drop it or end the effect (no action required).

Beetle Fire. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast the faerie fire spell from it, using your spell save DC. This version of the spell also creates a swarm of insects (which appear as Tiny fire beetles) immediately after you cast the spell. The swarm appears in a space of your choice within the spell's area. For the duration of the spell, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause the swarm to fly up to 60 feet toward a creature outlined by the spell and use its bite attack on it if it ends this movement in the creature's space. The swarm uses your spell attack bonus to hit, instead of its normal bonus. Once this property of the rod has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Illuminated Weapon. While the rod is glowing, it can also be used as a magic club. When you attack with the rod, you can use your spellcasting ability modifier, instead of Strength, for the attack and damage rolls.

### Voidknight's Maul
Weapon (maul), very rare (requires attunement by a paladin)

The crystalline head of this magic hammer has been bathed in the latent magic of the Astral Plane for untold millennia. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While you remain attuned to it, you age at one-tenth your normal rate.

Astral Smite. Whenever you use your Divine Smite feature against a creature, you can choose for it to deal psychic damage instead of radiant damage. Furthermore, when you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to use your Divine Smite, you can force the target of the attack to make a Constitution saving throw against your paladin spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is affected by the levitate spell. This version of the spell can affect multiple creatures at once, though you must still concentrate on the spell as normal. If your concentration on the spell ends, any affected creature gently floats back to the ground. Otherwise, you can use your action to move one or multiple targets affected by the spell vertically, up to 20 feet, dividing the movement between them. Each affected creature must remain within the spell's range.

### Shield of the Eldritch Maw
Armor (shield), very rare

The face of this shield is seemingly made of teeth, with a clear, fanglike line through its center. While holding this shield, you have a +2 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

Whenever a creature makes a melee attack roll against you while you're holding the shield, you can use your reaction to make a special melee attack with the shield against that target, with an attack bonus of +8. When you do, the shield splits apart to form a toothy maw, which opens wide and bites down on the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage plus 1d6 psychic damage. If you roll a 20 on the attack roll, the target is magically shunted to a special demiplane within the shield. The creature remains in the demiplane until you end the effect (no action required) or until you doff the shield, to a maximum of 1 minute, during which time it takes 1d4 acid damage plus 3d6 psychic damage at the end of each of its turns. A creature reduced to 0 hit points in the demiplane is devoured. At the start of each of its turns, the shunted creature can make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, it escapes the demiplane and reappears in the nearest unoccupied space to the shield. Only one creature can be in the demiplane at a time.


### Hunter's Cup
Wondrous item, rare

This wooden goblet is covered in a soft layer of moss. Three twisted antlers encircle it. It holds 1 cup of liquid.

When the goblet is filled from a free-flowing stream or pond, it begins to glow with a soft energy. Drinking the full goblet of glowing water using an action grants you the following benefits until you finish a short or long rest (to a maximum of 24 hours):

    You gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and Wisdom checks.
     
    You gain a +2 bonus to the damage rolls of your ranged weapon attacks.
     
    Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.
     
    Any bonus granted by the goblet is doubled while you're within a forest.

The water in the goblet ceases to glow after 24 hours or if it's moved more than 100 feet away from where it was filled. Once a creature has drunk from the goblet in this way, it can't be used again until 1d4 days have passed.


### Silver Dragon Katana
Weapon (longsword), rare

This shimmering silver katana is always cold to the touch, and a flurry of snow and ice trails behind it whenever it's swung. This sword has the finesse property, and when you hit with an attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d4 cold damage.

You can use an action to speak the weapon's command word and swing it down in front of you. When you do, a blast of freezing winds erupts in a 30-foot cone from the blade. Each creature within that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw as it's struck by the flurry of icy shrapnel. A creature takes 2d6 slashing damage, 2d6 piercing damage, and 2d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. Once this property of the sword has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.


### Worker's Wondrous Ladder
Rod, common

This wooden rod looks like the base of a simple ladder. While holding it, you can speak its command word using an action to cause a number of duplicate rods of your choice to appear, attached to the one you're holding. You must be holding the rod parallel to the ground; the rods attach in a vertical stack to create a ladder, starting from the rod you're holding. Each duplicate rod increases the height of the ladder by 1 foot, up to a maximum height of 20 feet. If this causes the ladder to hit another creature or object, it immediately stops short of that height. Each rod weighs 1 pound.

While holding one of the rods, you can use an action to speak its command word again to cause every other attached rod to magically disappear, leaving you with a single rod again.

"Oy! Throw me that ladder!"

### Metallurgists Grip
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This plated metal gauntlet extends up your arm. The armored plates are extensively corroded. If you're missing a hand or arm, the item can function as a prosthesis for it. While you're attuned to the gauntlet, it can't be removed from you against your will, and you have resistance to acid damage.

While wearing the gauntlet or using it as a prosthesis, you gain the following properties.

Absorb Acid. You can use your reaction whenever you take acid damage to reduce the acid damage you take by 2d6 + 3. When you do, the next melee weapon attack you make before the end of your next turn deals extra acid damage equal to the acid damage it reduced.

Caustic Overdrive. You can use a bonus action to cast the haste spell on yourself from the gauntlet. When you do, the spell doesn't require concentration, and you must roll a d6 at the end of each of your turns. You take acid damage equal to the result of the d6, which can't be prevented or reduced in any way. On a 1, the spell ends. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Winterland Footwraps
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a monk)

These blue straps keep a soft fur wrap held against your legs. While wearing them, you have resistance to cold damage, and the first time you hit a target with an unarmed strike on each of your turns, the target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage from the attack. In addition, you can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check, and difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost you extra movement.

When you use your Step of the Wind feature while wearing the wraps, you can walk on water until the end of your turn. When you do, the water beneath your feet magically freezes into a walkable path of floating ice, allowing you to step on it freely. The ice melts after 1 minute.

### Forest Eye Staff
Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)

While this staff is on your person, you can't be surprised. If you're in a forest, jungle, or similarly wooded area, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while holding the staff, and you can use an action to cast the locate animals or plants spell from it. This spell can't be cast from the staff again until the next dawn.

The staff has a magical leaf that flutters above its top. While holding the staff, you can use an action to speak its command word to cause the leaf to drift up to 30 feet away from the staff in a direction of your choice, as if it were carried by a breeze. You mentally receive visual information from the leaf, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet, and can look in every direction. The leaf can pass through any opening large enough for a leaf to slip through. The leaf then withers and turns to dust at the start of your next turn, but a new one magically appears above the staff at the next dawn.

### Cerberus Whistle
Wondrous item, rare


This whistle has been carved from a soot-stained imp bone. While holding the whistle, you can use an action to blow it. The whistle can be heard out to a range of 300 feet, but only by fiends and tieflings.

The whistle has three dog heads carved into its end. When found, the dogs' mouths are closed. When you blow into the whistle, one, two, or three of the mouths open (your choice each time). The harder you blow the whistle, the more of the dogs' mouths magically open.

For each mouth that opens as part of blowing the whistle, a hell hound is magically summoned to a random space that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each hell hound remains for 1 minute or until it's reduced to 0 hit points. If you are a fiend or tiefling, the hounds are friendly to you and your companions. Otherwise, each hounds' disposition is random: use the table below to determine the nature of each hound.

d6 | Disposition
:-- | :--
1 | Thehound is hostile towards you and your companions. It uses its action to attack you first
2-3 | The hound is equally hostile towards all creatures. It prioritizes the nearest creature to it that isn't a fiend or tiefling.
4-6 | The hound is friendly to you and your companions. It becomes hostile if you or one of your allies does something to harm or threaten it.

Roll initiative for the summoned hounds as a group, which has its own turns; hounds that are friendly to you go first. While the hounds are friendly to you, they obey your verbal commands (no action required). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.


### Staff of the Iron Cauldron
Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)


This iron staff has a thorny cauldron mounted at its head, which belches a noxious fume from its mouth. Grass and similarly Tiny mundane plants wither when its twisted end is planted on them. This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and it is always under the effects of the shillelagh spell.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: acid arrow (2 charges), antilife shell (5 charges), blight (4 charges), grease (1 charge), poison spray (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level), or stinking cloud (3 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff explodes into smoke and all plant life within 500 feet flourishes.

### Necromancer's Cuff
[TODO] cool artwork, for Warlock
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

The fingers of this dark silver ear cuff move to gently hold onto your ear. While wearing it, undead creatures can always understand the literal meaning of any language that you speak. In addition, you gain 3 temporary hit points whenever a living creature within 30 feet of you is slain. You can gain these temporary hit points even when you have 0 hit points: when you do, you're immediately stabilized, but are still unconscious.

### Amulet of the Guiding Eye
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)


This amulet features two eye-like pendants: one humanoid and one bestial. If you're within 5 feet of a friendly beast, such as a beast companion or familiar (including one created by the find familiar spell), you ignore the effects of being blinded, provided the beast isn't also blinded.

You can use an action to charm a Small or smaller beast that you're touching or that you can see within 30 feet of you, provided that it isn't hostile towards you. The beast is charmed by you for 24 hours, and it is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. This effect ends early if you use this feature again or if you or your companions do anything harmful to it. You can use an action to see through the beast's eyes while it's within 30 feet of you, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal sight. While seeing through the beast's eyes, you gain the benefits of any special senses that rely on sight possessed by that creature, though you are blinded to your own surroundings. Unless you have another way to command or control the beast, it shares your initiative in combat and uses its movement to remain within 5 feet of you. On its turn, it takes either the Dash or Dodge action.

### Unstoppable Heart
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This smooth, copper device looks a bit like a mechanical heart. Glowing red solution moves through its internal chambers and valves in perfect sequence. As part of attuning to the heart, you must hold it against your chest for the duration. Once you're attuned to it, it magically vanishes within your chest and begins to beat alongside your normal heart.

While inside your body, the heart grants you the following benefits:

     
    You can move an additional 10 feet whenever you take the Dash action.
     
    You have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to resist poison and to endure a forced march.
     
    You have resistance to poison damage.
     
    Whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, you double the number of hit points it restores.
     
    You stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn.
     
    You reduce your exhaustion level by two whenever you finish a long rest, instead of one.

If your attunement to the heart ends, it magically appears in your open hand or in the nearest unoccupied space.

### Cloak of Smoke and Cinder
[TODO] works nicely with wand of incense
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This short, hooded mantle is in threadbare tatters after being burned in a magical fire. While wearing it, the embers of that fire still burn, and plumes of smoke drape downward to replace the parts of the cloak that were lost.

While wearing the cloak, you have resistance to fire damage and ignore any penalties that come as a result of a target being obscured by smoke. It also functions as a cape of the mountebank.

Whenever another creature hits you with an attack on its turn while you're wearing the cloak, a cloud of smoke billows outward from the cloak, which heavily obscures you and the area around you in a 10-foot-radius sphere. The smoke vanishes at the end of the turn; a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) also disperses the smoke. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move, as well as while you're in an area of moderate or greater wind.


### Explorer's Helm
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While wearing this helmet, you're considered proficient with cartographer's tools. You also have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks, and you always know which way is north if you're outside. In addition, if you've been traveling at a consistent pace for at least 1 hour, nonmagical difficult terrain doesn't slow your travel while you continue at that pace.

### Quillgun
Weapon (blowgun), uncommon

This magic blowgun is made from a rough spruce branch. At its end is a collection of sharp porcupine quills. The blowgun has 30 quills and regains all expended quills daily at dawn; it then loads itself with 6 of those quills, unless it was already loaded with other ammunition.

If the blowgun is loaded with 6 quills in this way, it shoots each of those quills simultaneously at the same target when you make a ranged attack with it. You still make a single attack roll with the blowgun when you do, and you add your Dexterity modifier to the total of the attack's damage. On a hit, roll a d6 to determine how many of the quills hit the target; you then roll a number of d4s equal to the result, and the target takes piercing damage equal to the total of the d4s. At the end of the turn, the blowgun magically reloads itself with 6 new quills, unless you already loaded it with other ammunition.

The blowgun can also be wielded as a magic club. While it has at least 6 quills remaining, it deals an extra 1d4 piercing damage to any target it hits.

### Twin-Tuned Hammer
Weapon (light hammer), very rare (requires attunement)


This two-pronged hammer vibrates with a powerful force whenever it strikes a target. Despite the thunderous nature, the sound it creates can only be heard up to 30 feet away. A target hit with the hammer takes an extra 2d8 thunder damage from the attack, or 3d8 thunder damage if the target is made of stone, metal, or glass.

Whenever the hammer deals this bonus thunder damage, it continues to vibrate until the end of your next turn. If you're a bard, you gain the following benefits while holding it for the duration:
   
    Any target you grant a Bardic Inspiration die to also gains an additional Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d4. This d4 can't be used at the same time as the other Bardic Inspiration die, and lasts until the end of your next turn.
     
    You can roll a d4 and add it to your bard spell save DC whenever you cast a spell that deals thunder damage. This bonus ends immediately after you cast the spell.

### Bangle of Sun and Moon
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)


This bangle features a personified sun and moon, transitioning from gold to silver midway through the band. Three small diamonds mark their eyes. While wearing the bangle, you always know how long it is until sunrise, sunset, midday, and midnight.

The bangle has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can expend 2 of the bangle's charges to cast the daylight spell from it. Alternatively, you can expend 1 or more of the bangle's charges to cast the moonbeam spell from it (save DC 13). For 1 charge, you cast the 2nd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend. When you expend 2 or more charges to cast moonbeam in this way, you can choose whether the spell's damage type is cold, fire, or radiant.

If you have 11 or more levels in the druid class and are wearing this bangle, you can expend 3 charges from the bangle to cast the sunbeam spell from it (save DC 13). When you do, there is a permanent and cumulative 25 percent chance that the bangle is destroyed when the spell ends.

### Amulet of Initiative
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This amulet is actually a small gong-like bell. It emits a loud ring whenever you roll initiative, which is audible out to a range of 100 feet. You have advantage on initiative rolls while wearing the amulet. Further, your speed increases by 10 feet until the start of your second turn of combat, and you gain the following special reaction:

Knockout Parry. The first time you're hit with an attack before the start of your second turn of each combat, you can use your reaction to immediately make a single weapon attack against the attacker. This reaction can be used even if you're surprised, and allows you to draw a stowed weapon as part of it. If the total of your attack roll is equal to or lower than the attacker's, the triggering attack hits you, and yours misses; if yours is higher, the triggering attack misses you, and you hit the attacker instead. If you hit it with a melee attack, the attack deals an extra damage die of the weapon's type, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Champion's Shield
Armor (shield), very rare

This round metal shield is magically covered with 1d4 designs of mighty foes, such as dragons, vampires, or krakens. While holding this shield, you have a +2 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. In addition, you gain 10 temporary hit points each time a creature within 120 feet of you uses a legendary action; these temporary hit points end early if you are no longer holding the shield. If a creature with legendary actions is slain within that range, a new etching depicting that creature's final moments appears amongst the other images. When a creature uses a legendary action to make an attack roll against you or force you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction while holding the shield to impose disadvantage on the attack roll or grant yourself advantage on the saving throw.

The shield is always under the effects of the programmed illusion spell, and its triggering condition is when you use an action to touch a foe's design on the shield and speak the item's command word. The scripted performance is of that creature's final minute, before it was slain, and the illusion appears in a 5-foot cube in front of the shield.

### Owl Helm
[TODO] this is a cute early item
Wondrous item, common

This helm is designed in the likeness of an owl. While wearing it, you can magically turn your head completely around to face behind you. If the helm is removed, your head returns to a normal position.

When you make an ability check to interact with an owl or related creature, such as a giant owl or owlbear, and are wearing this helm, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check. Once you do, this property of the helm can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Ring of Dagger Ice
Ring, very rare (requires attunement)

This dark silver ring is always cold to the touch. The gemstone set in it is made of dagger ice: a magical ice fragment from the Everglacier. While wearing the ring, you have resistance to cold damage.

Rays of Frost. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to cast the ray of frost spell from it, using a spell attack bonus of +8. This version of the spell creates four rays, instead of one. Each ray can target the same or different targets. Make a ranged spell attack for each ray; on a hit, the target suffers the effects of the ray of frost spell as normal. If two rays hit the same target, the target's speed is reduced by half, instead of 10 feet (whichever is greater). If all four rays hit the same target, its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.

### Remorhaz Cloak
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This cloak is made using a strip of a remorhaz's winglike fins and is lightly reinforced with plates of its spined carapace. The first time you attune to this item, and then again each day at dawn, you can choose either cold or fire damage: you gain resistance to that damage type until you make the choice again.

Fiery Carapace. While wearing the cloak, you can use an action to immediately gain 20 temporary hit points, which last for 1 hour. While you have these temporary hit points, any creature within 5 feet of you that hits you with a weapon attack automatically takes 2d6 fire damage, as flames erupt from your wounds. If a creature reduces these temporary hit points to 0, a wave of fire explodes from the cloak. Each creature within 10 feet of you, other than you, takes 2d6 fire damage from the explosion. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Boiling Blood. If you're a barbarian and are wearing this cloak, your blood boils whenever you rage. While you don't have the temporary hit points from the cloak's Fiery Carapace property, any creature within 5 feet of you automatically takes 1d4 fire damage whenever it hits you with a weapon attack while you're raging.

### War Pick of Corrosion
Weapon (war pick), very rare (requires attunement)

This weapon resembles the head of an ancient black dragon: its two horns curl behind its head to form the weapon's sharp pick. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d4 acid damage to any target it hits. This extra acid damage is doubled if the target is made of metal or is wearing metal armor.

The weapon has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with the war pick, you can expend 1 of its charges to increase the pick’s acid damage by 3d4, to a total of 4d4 extra acid damage, for that attack; this acid damage is still doubled if the target is made of metal or is wearing metal armor. If the target is wearing metal armor, it must also succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or the armor takes a cumulative −2 penalty to the AC it offers, to a minimum of 10 AC, which lasts until it finishes a short or long rest.

### Whalefall Armor
Armor (half plate), very rare (requires attunement)

This armor is made of repurposed whale bone and lashed together with salt-stained leather strips. While wearing it, you have resistance to poison damage and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. If you're underwater, you also have advantage on any Wisdom (Animal Handling) or Charisma check you make to interact with beasts that have a swimming speed.

Charges. The armor has 5 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Spells. While wearing this armor, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 16): false life (2nd-level version, 1 charge), insect plague (4 charges; the insects appear as a massive swarm of rotting quippers), or stinking cloud (2 charges).

Bakekujira. While wearing the armor, you can use an action to speak its command word and expend any number of charges from the armor, including 0, to summon the spirit of the whale used to make its bone plates. The spirit appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. It uses the statistics for a killer whale, except that it's undead, is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and has a flying speed equal to its swimming speed. It obeys your mental commands to the best of its ability (no action required by you), and takes its turn immediately after yours. If you don't issue any commands, the spirit defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. The spirit disappears in a cloud of marine snow after 1 minute. It disappears early if you use an action to dismiss it or if it's reduced to 0 hit points.

When the spirit disappears, roll a d10. If the result is equal to or less than 5 + the number of charges you expended as part of the action to summon it, it disappears as normal, and the property can't be used again until the next dawn. If the result is higher than that number, the spirit becomes hostile to you; it remains for 1 additional minute, can't be dismissed, and immediately regains half its maximum number of hit points. When this happens, this property of the armor can't be used again until 1d4 + 1 days have passed, during which time the number of charges the armor regains each day is reduced by half (rounded up).


### Armor of the Reef Warden
Armor (half plate or plate), very rare (requires attunement)


This armor is formed from living coral. While you're attuned to it, the armor magically opens and closes around you whenever you don or doff it, as if you were a welcome part of its ecosystem. As a result, doing so takes only an action, instead of multiple minutes. You also gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed while wearing the armor, and you can walk normally on any surface while underwater (such as on a wall or ceiling).

A thriving community of various spectral fish swim around the armor while you wear it, which duck in and out of its many crevices. You can call upon these fish for a variety of benefits. Once a fish has been used in this way, that fish can't be used again until the next dawn.

Barracuda. When you take the Dash action, you can make a single weapon attack as part of the same action, as a spectral barracuda helps propel your attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if you're underwater.

Moray Eel. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can cause a pair of eels to wrap around and grapple the target. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be grappled and restrained by the spectral eels for up to 1 minute. A grappled creature takes 1d8 force damage and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If the target is underwater, it has disadvantage on the saving throw.

Pufferfish. When you're hit by a melee attack or are grappled by another creature, you can use your reaction to cause a spectral pufferfish to inflate itself between you and the other creature. That creature takes 3d4 force damage from the fish's sharp spines, and you're immediately moved up to 5 feet away from that creature. If you're underwater, you move up to 15 feet instead. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if you were grappled, you escape from it.

Surgeonfish. You can use a bonus action on your turn to create a swirling school of spectral fish around you. The fish remain until the start of your next turn and grant any creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you half cover for the duration. If you're underwater, the fish grant three-quarters cover instead.

### Hand Mirror of the Medusa
Wondrous item, very rare

This hand mirror bears the bust of a medusa at its top. Its silver surface is split into thirds by a pair of metal fangs. While holding it, you have advantage on saving throws against becoming petrified, and any creature with the Petrifying Gaze trait that starts its turn within 30 feet of you must also succeed on a saving throw against its own Petrifying Gaze trait. A medusa has disadvantage on the saving throw.

Petrifying Cone. You can use an action to brandish the mirror in front of you and speak its command word. When you do, you expose it to each creature in a 30-foot cone that originates from you, provided that the creature can see you. Each creature in the area is immediately affected by the flesh to stone spell (save DC 16); you must concentrate on the spell as normal. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the mirror has been used to petrify a creature with its own Petrifying Gaze trait.

### Ringmaster's Top Hat
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

This colorful top hat carries a perpetual air of revelry and frivolity with it. While wearing the hat, you can use an action to cast the thaumaturgy spell from it, and you have proficiency with whips.

While wearing the hat, you can use an action to turn invisible, disappearing into a cloud of smoke when you do. The cloud heavily obscures the space you vanished from, and it remains there until the start of your next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. When you vanish in this way, you magically teleport to another space that you can see within 30 feet of you. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you make an attack or cast a spell. Once this property of the hat has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Crown of the Forgotten Circle
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a druid)

This flower crown is forever dried and wilted, and is filled with nettles and briars. While wearing it, you have resistance to necrotic and poison damage, and you always have the blight and spike growth spells prepared. These spells don't count against the total number of spells you can prepare each day.

As an action while wearing the crown, you can choose a point on the ground that you can see within 120 feet of you to cause a dense cluster of nettles to spring forth. The nettles grow in a 30-foot-radius circle, centered on that point, which last for 10 minutes before withering and turning to dust. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration for all creatures other than you. An affected creature that starts its turn in the nettles or enters them for the first time on its turn immediately takes 2d4 poison damage. If a creature takes 10 or more poison damage from the briars before the effect ends, that creature becomes poisoned for 1 hour. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Curse. This crown is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling and unable to remove the crown. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the number of hit points is reduced by 5 + the spell's level, as the crown's flowers try and fail to rejuvenate themselves with your magic.

### Mithral Beast Charms
[TODO] In the lower levels of Mithdral
Wondrous item, uncommon

These mithral charms resemble a type of woodland beast and can be easily worn on jewelry or carried by hand. You can use an action to touch a charm and speak its command word—typically the creature's name in Sylvan—to cause one or more of that creature to appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. Such a creature is considered to be fey, instead of beast, and is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands to the best of its ability (no action required by you), and takes its turn immediately after yours. A summoned creature remains for up to 10 minutes, but disappears early if you use an action to end the effect or if it's reduced to 0 hit points.

Once the charm has been used, it loses its magic and can't be used again. When found, the GM chooses the kind of charm it is or determines it randomly from the table below. When you summon a creature using the charm, you choose which beast it takes the form of, summoning the corresponding number of them.

Monkey, Bear, Boar, Deer(stag), Frog, Panther

### Sickle of the Sphinx
[TODO] make this have Finesse
Weapon (sickle), rare (requires attunement by a creature with an Intelligence score of 13 or higher)

The blade of this sickle is made of an azure crystal. Peering through the translucent blade conjures a flurry of existential questions to your mind. You gain a +1 bonus to any Intelligence check or Intelligence saving throw you make while attuned to the sickle. You're proficient with the sickle of the sphinx while you're attuned to it, and it deals an extra 1d4 psychic damage to any creature it hits.

While holding the sickle, you can use a bonus action to pose a mind-altering question (such as a riddle or philosophical prompt) to another creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you and understands at least one language. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage. This psychic damage increases by 1d4 each time you use this property against the same creature on a consecutive turn, to a maximum of 3d4 psychic damage.

### Cloudburst
Weapon (any bow), rare


This magic bow is weightless to hold. The shapes of its extending arms change ever so slightly while held, but always resemble a pair of stylized clouds, and a faint mist wraps around it. The normal range of cloudburst is 30 feet more than a typical bow of its type.

Whenever you use this bow to fire an arrow into water vapor, such as into a low-lying mist or fog cloud spell, the vapor immediately disappears from the area in a 10-foot-wide line, following the arrow's trajectory; fog can't reenter that space until the end of your next turn. Air elementals and other creatures made of clouds or mist take an extra 2d6 force damage from ranged attacks using the bow.

### Trap Sweeper
Wondrous item, uncommon

You can use an action to speak this broom's command word and sweep the ground with it. When you do, dirt and dust is kicked up by the broom in a 30-foot cone originating from it. The dirt and dust magically glows and clings to the edges of any trap, clearly outlining it for all to see. The trap remains outlined in this way for 1 minute.

Once the broom has been used to sweep for the third time in this way, it can't do so again until 1d4 − 1 days have passed. If you roll a 1 on the d4, the broom regains all uses of this property and can be used again immediately.

A trap, for the purpose of this item, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the item would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

### Staff of the Arcanum
Staff, legendary (requires attunement by a wizard)

This staff is made of both raw and polished obsidian. Your Intelligence and Wisdom scores each increase by 2, up to a maximum of 22, while you're attuned to it. In addition, you can use your Arcane Recovery twice between long rests, instead of once.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls. A target hit with the staff takes an extra 1d10 force damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from you.

Spell Storing. This staff stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The staff can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the staff by touching the staff as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the staff. If the staff can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While holding this staff, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the staff is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

Sentience. The staff of the arcanum is a sentient chaotic good staff with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 13. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The staff communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. While you're attuned to it, it also understands every language you know.

Personality. The staff of the arcanum is bookish and, at times, stuck up. It enjoys unraveling puzzles. It refuses to lend its strength to liches, however, preventing them and similar necromancers from using the staff's properties. At the GM's discretion, the staff may choose to cast a stored spell on its own (no action required by you).

### Lucky Horseshoes
Wondrous item, rare

Lucky horseshoes normally come in a set of four: one for each of a horse's hooves. Each one shines with a brilliant, brassy luster and has a single four-leaf clover at its center. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, the creature gains a +1 bonus to any ability check or saving throw it makes.

Luck. Each horseshoe has this property. When a creature wearing the shoes either misses with an attack roll or fails an ability check or saving throw, it can use its reaction to automatically hit or succeed on the roll instead. When this happens, one of the horseshoes immediately tarnishes and loses this property.

This effect can't allow the creature to do the impossible. For example, even with the aid of a lucky horseshoe, a horse can't succeed on an ability check in such a way that allows it to magically fly—doing that would require a set of horseshoes of a zephyr instead.

### Staff of the Cauldron Carrier
Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
This iron and brass staff holds a cauldron at its end. Despite its materials, it only weighs as much as a normal staff. While you're attuned to it, you gain a +1 bonus to any ability check using alchemy supplies, cook's utensils, or an herbalism kit.

Spells. The staff has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: burning hands (1 charge), create food and water (3 charges), detect poison and disease (1 charge), heat metal (2 charges), or purify food and drink (1 charge). This version of the create food and water spell grants 1d6 + 4 temporary hit points to any creature that consumes a meal that it creates. The food created by the spell is delicious.


### Halo Circlet
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This lustrous, gilded circlet hovers just above your head while worn. The inside of the circlet radiates with a golden glow, like a halo. While wearing it, you can speak, read, and write Celestial. In addition, you can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of your next turn. When you do, a pair of glimmering wings of golden light appear just behind your back for the duration.

While wearing the circlet, you can use your reaction to shroud yourself in celestial energy whenever you take fire damage, necrotic damage, or radiant damage from a hostile source. When you do, you have resistance to that damage type, including the triggering damage, until the start of your next turn. You also gain a secondary effect that depends on the type of damage dealt:
  
    Fire damage. The triggering fire damage is quartered, instead of halved.
     
    Necrotic damage. The first target you hit with an attack on your next turn takes an extra 2d10 necrotic damage from the attack.
     
    Radiant damage. You can use a bonus action to restore 2d8 hit points to a creature you touch on your next turn.

Divine Opposition. If you're a tiefling and are wearing the circlet, you can choose to deal radiant damage, instead of fire damage, whenever you would deal fire damage to a target. In addition, you can use a bonus action to release a wave of beautiful, discordant energy from the circlet. The wave affects up to 8 creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. You choose if an affected creature is either affected by the bless spell or is forced to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw; on a failed save, it's affected by the bane spell instead. These spells end at the start of your next turn, and any creature affected by them adds or subtracts 2d4 from its rolls, respectively, instead of 1d4. Once this bonus action has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.


### Amulet of the Platinum Fang
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)


A single fang—said to be from a deific dragon—hangs on this platinum necklace. The tooth itself is cracked but repaired with molten platinum, sealing it together and retaining its inherent magic. You have resistance to radiant damage while wearing this amulet. In addition, whenever a spell restores hit points to you, you also gain 1d6 + 4 temporary hit points.

Platinum Aspect. While wearing the amulet, you can use an action to call forth an instantaneous, spectral maw of a platinum dragon. Make a melee spell attack with the maw against a target within 15 feet of you, using a +10 spell attack bonus. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 + 10 force damage plus 4d6 radiant damage. Once you've used this property, you can't do so again until the next dawn.

If you're a dragonborn, you can choose to use this property in place of your breath weapon. When you do, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest, instead of the next dawn. If you use your normal breath weapon, you can choose for it to deal radiant damage, instead of its normal damage type.


### Crown of Season's Embrace
[TODO] Season themed, rework for nyari
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by an elf, half-elf, or fey)

This silver crown of tangled branches is dotted with tiny jewels, with a larger diamond resting at its center. While wearing the crown, you can change the shape of your ears using a bonus action. You also gain the elf's Trance racial trait if you don't already have it.

The crown has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn.

Spells. While wearing the crown, you can use an action to expend 4 of its charges to cast the dimension door spell; alternatively, you can use a bonus action to expend 2 charges to cast the misty step spell from it.

Season Change. When you first attune to the crown, and then again daily at dawn, you can choose a season for the crown to resonate with. When you do, the gemstones on the crown change color to match the respective season, and you gain resistance to the damage type associated with it. You can use a bonus action to expend 3 of the crown's charges to immediately change the associated season. Use the table below to determine what color and damage type is associated with each season.

Winter | Blue | Cold
Spring | Green | Radiant
Summer | Gold | Fire
Autumn | Orange | Necrotic


### Solacesteel Requiem
Weapon (pike), rare (requires attunement)

This weapon is made of sanctified mourningsteel. Whenever you hit a target with this weapon, roll an additional damage die and ignore the lowest result. If the target is undead, the weapon deals radiant damage, instead of piercing damage, and uses the total of all rolled damage dice.

In addition, while holding the pike, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to release an empowering wave of energy. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you (including yourself) immediately gains 1d10 + 10 temporary hit points. These hit points remain until the end of your next turn, during which time each affected creature has advantage on any attack roll or Wisdom saving throw it makes. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of this wave increases to 30 feet. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Crown of the Cursed King
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)

This tarnished crown was originally worn by a maddened king, whose hunger for power could seemingly not be stopped. Only with old age was his reign brought to an eventual end, at which time all symbols of his power were systematically destroyed, including this crown. However, his malevolent spirit remains in the form of magical strands of force that hold its pieces together—a lasting sign of his unwillingness to cede his rule.

The crown has the following properties.

Curse Bestowment. While wearing this crown, you can use an action to touch a creature and cast the bestow curse spell on it from the crown (save DC 16). If you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can cast the spell on that creature in this way (as if you were touching it) before the end of your next turn. You must be able to see the creature.

Curse Suppression. While wearing this crown, any curse affecting you is suppressed. For each suppressed curse, you gain a +1 bonus to any attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make (up to a maximum bonus of +3). Your attunement to a cursed magic item can't be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, even if its effects are suppressed by the crown. Curses from an artifact can't be suppressed in this way.

Rule of the Iron Fist. While attuned to the crown, your Strength and Charisma scores each increase by 2, up to a maximum of 22.

Curse. This crown is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. The effects of this curse aren't suppressed by the crown's Curse Suppression, but nevertheless contribute to the bonus you gain as part of that property. You are immune to the effects of remove curse while wearing the crown.

While cursed, you gain the following flaw: "I am always in danger of losing everything. I must ensure my legacy is preserved." In addition, you are unwilling to part with the crown, wearing it atop your head at all times. It can't be removed from your head against your will.


### Wand of Incense
[TODO] works nicely with the smoke cape
Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

This item is a magic incense holder sculpted in the design of a smoldering dragon. Its base is wrapped in leather and doubles as the handle of a wand. A stick of special, magic incense appears in the holder daily at dawn, which is held in place by the dragon's mouth and can't be removed until it's burned away. The special incense smells like heady brimstone and fills you with a sense of confidence. While a stick of incense is in the holder, it doubles as a wand.

The wand has 3 charges for the following properties. When the special incense reappears at dawn, so too do the wand's 3 charges; the incense only burns down when you expend the wand's charges, doing so proportionally to the number it has remaining. If any of the special incense is remaining when the new stick appears, it's replaced by the new one.

Spells. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using a spell attack bonus of +7: find familiar (form of a pseudodragon), fog cloud (the cloud is made of smoke), misty step, or scorching ray. If your attunement to the wand ends, the familiar is lost. When you cast misty step in this way, you leave behind and reappear in a cloud of smoke that heavily obscures both spaces until the start of your next turn.

Draconic Ward. While you can smell the burning incense, you can't be frightened by dragons. In addition, a dragon that smells the incense has disadvantage on any attack roll it makes against you.

If you have a normal stick of incense, you can use an action to place it in the empty holder. Normal incense burned in the holder never loses any of its total burn time, but is expelled from the holder when the special incense appears each dawn. Incense burned from the holder can be smelled by any creature within 60 feet of it. While holding the wand, you can choose whether or not the incense is burning (no action required).

### Hammer of Whispers
Weapon (light hammer), uncommon (requires attunement)

This dark silver hammer is miraculously light. It has the finesse property, and any target hit with it takes an extra 1d4 psychic damage. Hitting a target with the hammer produces no sound.

Curse. This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the hammer, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using this weapon, make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, your mind is plagued with mysterious whispers; you take 2d6 psychic damage and are incapacitated until the end of your next turn.

### Solacesteel Plate
[TODO] for Nyari
Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)

This gilded armor is made of purified mourningsteel and repels undead aggression. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on any saving throw against a hostile effect from an undead creature. In addition, you can use a bonus action to touch a creature with 0 hit points. When you do, the creature is stabilized.

If you're a cleric or paladin and are wearing this armor, immediately after an undead creature deals damage to you with a melee attack, it is automatically destroyed if its challenge rating is 1 or lower.


### Cloth of Instant Tables
[TODO] good early reward
Wondrous item, common

This rolled up table cloth is secured by a wood-patterned ring. You can use an action to slide the cloth from the ring and flourish it—as if you're about to set a table with it. When you do, a wooden table magically appears on the ground beneath the cloth, provided that there's space for it. The table is 3 feet wide and 5 feet long; the cloth's ring is wrapped around one of its four legs, which can hold as much weight as a normal table's. The table is equipped with two attached benches, which can comfortably sit up to 6 Medium creatures.

The table remains until the cloth is removed from the table, which can be done using an action. As part of the action to remove the cloth and dismiss the table, you can roll it up and secure the cloth within the ring. If the table is destroyed, the cloth becomes a nonmagical table cloth.

### Sonar Arrow
Weapon (arrow), rare

This long, dark arrow looks as though it's been pierced through a bat. A target hit by this arrow takes an extra 2d10 thunder damage. Hit or miss, when the arrow first impacts with a creature, object, or other solid surface, it emits a brief, magical frequency, which is audible out to a range of 120 feet. Every creature that isn't deafened within the sound's range magically knows the location of every other physical creature and any obvious, uncovered object within the frequency's area at that moment. The arrow then loses its magic and becomes a normal arrow.

A creature that has the Keen Hearing trait gains a +5 bonus to any Wisdom (Perception) check it makes until the end of its next turn after hearing the frequency. If the arrow hits a creature with this trait, it takes an extra 3d10 thunder damage from the attack, instead of 2d10.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as sonar bolts meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.

### Blossoming Arrow
Weapon (arrow), rare

This twig-like arrow is fletched with split leaves and dotted with tiny blossoms. Its point is a complicated, bulb-like mass, which seems to cover a collection of strange glowing pustules at its center.

A creature hit by this arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison damage from the attack, or 3d6 if the creature is a plant, and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned for 1 hour. A poisoned creature gains the plant type, in addition to its other creature types, for as long as it remains poisoned. After the arrow deals this poison damage, it loses its magic.

Alternatively, if the arrow is planted or otherwise stuck in soil and left to rest for 30 days, it magically transforms into an awakened tree at the end of that time. This awakened tree is immune to poison damage and is covered in small, beautiful flowers. Until the arrow transforms into a tree in this way, you can remove it from the soil to use it as an arrow.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as blossoming bolts meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.

### Blazeblood Signet
Ring, very rare (requires attunement)

The gem at the center of this dark silver ring is always warm to the touch. While wearing the ring, your blood feels unnaturally hot, and it feels as though the ring itself pulses to match your heartbeat. You gain the following benefits while wearing this ring:
   
    You regain all of your spent Hit Dice whenever you finish a long rest.
     
    Whenever you spend Hit Dice to regain hit points at the end of a short rest, you automatically regain the maximum number of hit points possible.
     
    You can tolerate temperatures as low as −50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection. If you wear heavy clothes, you can tolerate temperatures as low as −100 degrees Fahrenheit.

Blood Conversion. While wearing this ring, you can choose to spend 1 or more Hit Dice whenever you hit a creature with an attack, up to a maximum of 5 Hit Dice per turn. For each Hit Die spent, roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You immediately gain temporary hit points equal to half the total (rounded up), and the target of the attack takes fire damage equal to the same amount.

Curse. This ring is cursed, and attuning to it extends the curse to you. For as long as you remain cursed, you regain half as many hit points whenever a spell or magical effect restores them.

### Chain Acolyte Robes
Armor (chain mail), rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

These acolyte robes are draped in heavy chain mail. You are proficient with this armor and ignore its Strength requirement if you have a spellcasting ability score of at least 13.

Spells. While wearing the armor, you can use an action to cast either the hold monster or hold person spell from the armor, using your spell save DC. When you do, the spell holds the target in place with magical chains; for the spell's duration, the target takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage from the chains at the start of each of its turns. Once you cast a spell in this way, that spell can't be cast from the armor again until the next dawn.

Wand of Binding. If you are also attuned to a wand of binding, it regains all expended charges daily at dawn. In addition, whenever you use the wand to cast hold monster or hold person, you can choose to have it cast the armor's version of the spell instead. You still use the wand's save DC when casting the spell in this way.

### Dart of Caltrops
Weapon (dart), uncommon

The tip of this all-metal dart resembles a single caltrop. If you hit a creature with a ranged attack using the dart, that creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until it regains at least 1 hit point (as if it had stepped on spread caltrops). Hit or miss, countless, magical caltrops burst from the dart to cover the ground in each space adjacent to the target. The caltrops remain for 1 minute, at which point they turn to dust and are destroyed.

Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the dart can still be used as a magic weapon.

### Molten Hammer
Weapon (maul), very rare (requires attunement)

This hammer is pulled like glass from molten rock and glows with residual heat from within. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to any target it hits.

Overheat. Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with this hammer, you can cause the hammer to magically overheat. When you do, the attack deals an extra 2d8 fire damage. You then take fire damage equal to half this amount, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way.

### Relentless Stinger
Weapon (rapier), rare

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic rapier. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using this weapon, the next target you hit with it before the end of your next turn takes an extra 10 piercing damage from the attack.


### Gloom Shield
Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)

This tall shield is made from the sculpted lid of a coffin. A skeletal figure rests embossed on its surface, reminding would-be attackers of their own mortality.

The shield has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dusk. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the fear spell from the shield (save DC 15). A creature that fails the saving throw also takes 4d6 psychic damage. Alternatively, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack while you're holding the shield, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the shield's charges to force that creature to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it immediately takes 4d6 psychic damage and is frightened of you for until the end of its next turn.

### Axe of Hurricanes
Weapon (any axe), uncommon

You can use an action to create a powerful whirlwind around you by swinging this magic weapon. Make a melee attack with the axe against each creature within 5 feet of you (other than yourself), with a separate attack roll for reach target. Immediately after the attacks, each creature within 15 feet of you (other than you) must also make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage. It takes a second 1d8 bludgeoning damage if it's within 10 feet of you, and a third 1d8 if it's within 5 feet. If the creature is Medium or smaller, it's also thrown up to 10 feet away from you. On a success, a creature takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't thrown.

Once this property of the axe has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Lunar Compass
Wondrous item, rare

This compass has a glass eye on its lid, allowing you to see it even while it's closed. At its center is a shallow moon sculpture, which is always magically shaded to match the current phase of the moon it represents. During the day, the item functions exactly like a normal compass.

While holding the compass between dusk and dawn, it emits dim light in a 5-foot radius. During this time, you can use an action to speak its command word, followed by the name of a specific fixed location on the same plane of existence as you. If you are outside and can see at least one moon, the needle then points in the direction of the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest one) to that location. This effect is suspended if you can no longer see the moon (such as if you enter a cave or dense forest), and it ends at dawn or when you're no longer holding the compass. Once you use this property of the compass, it can't be used again until the next dusk.

### Chapel Lantern
[TODO] cool flavor item for crypt adventure
Wondrous item, uncommon

This stained glass lantern casts colorful lights around it while lit, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Alternatively, you can fill the lantern with a flask of holy water. While holding it, you can use an action to magically reduce the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.

When the lantern is lit using holy water, the light that it sheds almost shimmers with divine magic. When lit in this way, any undead creature within the lantern's bright light has disadvantage on any attack roll it makes. Further, if such a creature starts its turn within the bright light, it immediately takes 1d6 radiant damage.

Each time that an undead creature takes radiant damage as result of the lantern's bright light, deduct 1 hour from the lantern's total burn time.

### Patch of the Open Eye
Wondrous item, common

This canvas patch can be magically attached to a piece of clothing by pressing it against the clothing for 1 minute. The patch remains on the clothing until it falls off or you use an action to remove it. While it's attached to a piece of clothing, the eye's pupil will occasionally dart off to the side before returning back to the center.

While the patch is attached to a piece of clothing you're wearing, you can't be surprised at the start of combat. Once the patch prevents you from being surprised in this way, it falls off. Alternatively, you can choose to peel off the patch as part of making a Wisdom (Perception) check. You make this decision after you roll the d20, but before knowing the result of the check. When you do, roll a d4 and add it to the total.

Once the patch has been removed from a piece of clothing it's attached to, the patch loses its magic and becomes a mundane patch. If the magic patch is removed from a robe of useful items, the patch has a 50 percent chance to keep its magical properties and can be reattached to a piece of clothing again.

### Gemini Mask
[TODO] this can probably be reworked to something cool for Ayra
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This half-mask remains securely on your face thanks to its full-width diadem, which extends from the mask around the rest of your brow. It functions as a hat of disguise. When you use an action to cast the disguise self spell from the mask, you can choose to appear identical to another creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. When you do, you can appear up to 3 feet shorter or taller to match the target's height.

Twin Sense. For the duration of this version of the spell, you gain the following benefits:
    
    You always know the general direction and distance of the other creature from you.
     
    When the other creature makes an attack against a target, you gain advantage on the first attack roll you make against the same target before the start of the other creature's next turn.
     
    You can use an action to see through the creature's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. If the creature is unwilling, it first makes an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, it's magically made aware of this effect—though not of you or its source—and the spell and effect ends. If a creature is immune to divination magic or is under the effects of a spell or magical effect that prevents such magic, you see and hear nothing from the creature's senses, and it automatically succeeds on the saving throw.
     
    The spell ends early if you're more than 1 mile away from the other creature.



### Ioun Blade
[TODO] cool dagger art usable for Mufi


### Rope Cobra
[TODO] cool early item
Wondrous item, common

You can use an action while holding this 30-foot length of hempen rope to speak its command word. The rope then magically animates and transforms (slightly) into a cobra made of rope. As part of this action, and then again as an action on each of your turns for the duration, you can issue the snake a verbal command, such as "tie yourself around that pillar." The snake only obeys the commands of the creature that animated it. The rope returns to normal and ceases to be animated after 1 minute, after it moves more than 120 feet, or when you use an action to speak its command word again; it can't be animated again until the next dawn.

The snake has 2 hit points, like normal rope, although it has resistance to all damage. It has AC 11 and a speed of 30 feet; it can climb walls and objects that aren't smooth at half its normal speed. The snake also has blindsight out to a range of 30 feet, is blind beyond that radius, can't attack, and has an escape DC of 10. If the rope is destroyed, whether it's animated or not, it becomes a normal length of nonmagical rope.

### Obsidian Star
[TODO] rework this a little bit as a anti mage + arcane trickster blade
Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement)

A favorite amongst mage hunters, this midnight-dark obsidian dagger sparkles like starlight. While in darkness, you can clearly see the cosmos in its blade. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If left outdoors under starlight for 8 hours, it automatically regains all expended charges at dawn instead.

When you hit a creature with the dagger, you can expend 1 of its charges to force the target to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes an extra 2d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If the creature is a spellcaster and fails the saving throw, it also can't cast spells of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level for 1 minute. It can make another DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns for the duration, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Whip of the Copper Eel
[TODO] probably cool if reworked

### Lightning Caltrops
Wondrous item, uncommon

These magic caltrops function like normal caltrops when scattered. When a creature takes lightning damage while standing on a space covered in these caltrops, that creature takes an extra 2d8 lightning damage. Once a creature in that space takes lightning damage in this way, or if the caltrops themselves are targeted by an effect that deals lightning damage, the caltrops become charged with electrical power. The caltrops remain charged for 1 minute or until a creature takes damage by stepping on them. Any creature that takes damage from stepping on the charged caltrops also takes an extra 2d8 lightning damage and can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. If a creature wearing metal armor steps on the charged caltrops and succeeds on the Dexterity saving throw, it still takes 1d8 lightning damage from the caltrops but does not end their charge.

If a set of lightning caltrops is scattered on the ground within 15 feet of another one, charging either set of caltrops also charges the other.

### Navis Anima
Wondrous item, legendary

A navis anima, or simply an anima, is a sentient gemstone that rests upon a magic pedestal. The gemstone can't be separated from the pedestal, despite the fact that the stone seems only loosely placed atop it. While the anima is on a vehicle, you can perform a ritual to name the gemstone and vehicle, magically binding the two together. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires a bottle of fine wine worth at least 100 gp. Once complete, the pedestal anchors itself to the vehicle and alters its appearance to match the vehicle's design. The chosen name then magically appears on the vehicle in a place of your choice, replacing any name that was already on it. A named anima cannot be renamed.

While an anima is bound to a vehicle, the vehicle is capable of travel at slow pace even if its usual source of movement isn't present. For example, a carriage bound to an anima could travel at a slow pace even without horses, as its wheels would magically rotate under the anima's control. The anima can make ability checks for the vehicle, using its vehicle's statistics, and it can grant any creature of its choice advantage on ability checks made to steer or otherwise control the vehicle, provided that the anima and chosen creature share at least one language. Conversely, any creature that attempts to control the vehicle against the anima's will has disadvantage on any ability check made to do so.

An anima can only be separated from its vehicle by the destruction of that vehicle. When this happens, the anima becomes dormant. It can be bound to a new vehicle by performing the naming ritual again, although it fails if you attempt to assign the gemstone a new name. The gemstone's name then appears on the new vehicle.

Sentience. A navis anima is a sentient magic item of any alignment. When the anima is first named, it begins with an Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma score of 10. Then, roll three d6s and add each result to a different one of those scores, recording each total as its new score for that attribute. The anima has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. It can see, hear, and feel anything as if it were in any space occupied by the bound vehicle.

The anima can speak and read Common and can communicate telepathically with creatures in physical contact with its vehicle. It can learn up to three additional languages; each new language requires it to travel for 30 days with a crew that primarily communicates using that language.

Personality. A navis anima is initially blank. Once it has been part of a naming ritual, however, it quickly forms a personality based on its given name, its bound vehicle, and its early interactions with other creatures. For example, a general's warship named the Lord's Blade may have an aggressive, militaristic personality, while a merchant's cart named the Timetable may be meticulous and punctual. However, all animas are protective of those they consider their crew and will prioritize their crew's interests over the interests of others.


### Weapon of Blind Faith
[TODO] cool feature for other weapons

### Scroll of Rugs
[TODO] make this something for early game, make creatures fall prone?

### Spatha of Martial Mastery
Weapon (shortsword), rare (requires attunement by a barbarian, fighter, monk, or rogue)

A long white ribbon trails behind this shimmering sword, whose blade is forged with swirls of gold. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, you gain the following benefits.

Cunning Strike. If you have 5 or more levels in the rogue class, you can use your Cunning Action feature to make a single attack with this weapon as a bonus action if you do not use an action to make a weapon attack or cast a spell on the same turn, as you master the balance of offense and improvisation.

Freed Hand. If you have 5 or more levels in the barbarian class, any target you hit with this weapon while raging takes an extra 1d6 piercing damage from it, as you master both brutal blows and the free exercise of your strength. You don't gain this benefit if you're holding a weapon or shield in your other hand.

Ki Channeling. If you have 5 or more levels in the monk class, you can use this weapon in place of any unarmed strike you make, as you master the grace and flow of your swordplay. Any feature that relies on or benefits your unarmed strikes, such as your Flurry of Blows or Martial Arts features, also applies to this weapon. In addition, whenever you use your Step of the Wind feature as a bonus action, you can immediately make one melee attack with the sword as part of that action.

Manipulating Attack. If you have 5 or more levels in the fighter class, you can take the Use an Object action or shove a target within your reach once per turn immediately after making an attack with this sword as part of the Attack action, as you master versatile tactics to shift the flow of battle. You can only push a target up to 5 feet away from you when you shove it in this way, but can choose to make the contested check using Dexterity (Acrobatics) instead of a Strength (Athletics) when you do.

### Unicorn Diadem
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)

A unicorn’s horn rests at the center of this diadem. While wearing the diadem, you can use it as a spellcasting focus, as if you were holding it. In addition, you have resistance to poison damage and have advantage on saving throws against poison. When you cast a spell while wearing the diadem, you can change the spell’s damage type for that casting to radiant damage, unless its normal damage type is necrotic.

While wearing the diadem, you can use an action to touch another creature and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. That creature then gains a +2 bonus to its AC until the start of your next turn and regains a number of hit points equal to 5 times the level of the spell slot you expended. If these hit points would cause that creature to exceed its hit point maximum, it gains half of those excess hit points as temporary hit points.

### Dragonwing Scimitars
Weapon (scimitar), legendary (requires attunement)

This pair of twin scimitars features draconic guards and winglike blades. Despite there being two weapons, they are considered to be a single item for the purposes of attuning to them. While holding one of the swords, you always know the general direction and distance of the other.

Chromatic Change. Each of the swords is associated with a damage type: either acid, cold, fire, lightning or poison. Any target hit by one of the scimitars takes an extra 1d10 damage of its associated type. While one of them is in your hand, you can use a bonus action to change its damage type to a different one. When you do, the color of its metal changes to reflect the new damage type.

Draconic Riposte. While holding each of the swords in either hand, you can use your reaction when you're hit by a melee attack to gain a +4 bonus to your AC against the triggering attack, potentially causing it to miss you. If the attack misses as a result of this reaction and the attacker is within 5 feet of you, you can immediately make an opportunity attack against the attacker using one of the scimitars.

Winged Rush. While you're holding the two swords in either hand, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed whenever you take the Dash action. You lose this speed at the end of your turn, falling if you are in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.

### Hagstone Amulets
Wondrous item, uncommon

A hagstone is a naturally occurring stone that's pockmarked with holes and crystalline veins. To be transformed into a magical hagstone amulet, it must be made by a hag. If a hag decides to give away one of these amulets, it always comes at a price.

On its own, a hagstone amulet does nothing. However, you can perform a 1-hour ritual to bind three or more amulets. If three or more bound hagstone amulets are worn by different creatures that are within 30 feet of one another, those creatures can use an action to cast either bestow curse or lightning bolt from their amulet (save DC 13). Alternatively, a creature can cast counterspell from the amulet as a reaction, using a spellcasting ability modifier of +3.

Once a spell has been cast from an amulet, that spell can't be cast again from it or any other hagstone amulet bound to it until the next dawn.

### Sahuagin Sabatons
Wondrous item, uncommon

A hagstone is a naturally occurring stone that's pockmarked with holes and crystalline veins. To be transformed into a magical hagstone amulet, it must be made by a hag. If a hag decides to give away one of these amulets, it always comes at a price.

On its own, a hagstone amulet does nothing. However, you can perform a 1-hour ritual to bind three or more amulets. If three or more bound hagstone amulets are worn by different creatures that are within 30 feet of one another, those creatures can use an action to cast either bestow curse or lightning bolt from their amulet (save DC 13). Alternatively, a creature can cast counterspell from the amulet as a reaction, using a spellcasting ability modifier of +3.

Once a spell has been cast from an amulet, that spell can't be cast again from it or any other hagstone amulet bound to it until the next dawn.

### Wand of the Plagueswarm
Wand, very rare (requires attunement)

This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand dissolves into a fetid slime that sizzles and evaporates, destroying the wand and leaving behind a stain that can never be cleaned.

Spells. While holding the wand, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 16): bestow curse (1 charge), blight (2 charges), conjure animals (1 charge; summons two giant toads or four giant frogs), contagion (3 charges), darkness (1 charge), harm (4 charges), ice storm (2 charges), or insect plague (3 charges). These versions of the bestow curse and contagion spells have a range of 30 feet, instead of touch.

Endless Plagues. Whenever your concentration ends on a spell that you cast from the wand, you can immediately use your reaction to cast a different spell from it that also requires concentration, provided you're still holding the wand. You must expend the respective number of charges to cast the spell, as normal.

Curse. This curse is only revealed if the wand is destroyed as a result of expending its last charge, extending the curse to you when that happens. You can end your attunement to this wand as normal, even though it's cursed. While you're cursed, you are also diseased. Only a wish spell can end this curse and disease. While diseased, you have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws, and you must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence check whenever you attempt to use a magic item property. On a failed save, your action to use the item is wasted. For example, casting a spell from a wand would be considered as using one of its properties, but attacking with a +1 longsword wouldn't.

### Adrenal Blades
[TODO] maybe cool for Kazimir
Weapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)

This pair of scimitars are made of darkened steel and have feather-like designs. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons, which are considered to be a single item for the purposes of attuning to them. While holding one of the swords, you always know the general direction and distance of the other. While the swords are on your person, choose one of the following benefits whenever you roll initiative. These benefits last for 1 minute.

Fight. The weapons' bonus increases to +3, instead of +1. You have advantage on opportunity attacks made with them.

Flight. You gain a flying speed of 40 feet, but fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft. Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

In addition, if a creature forces you to make a saving throw against becoming frightened, you can immediately use your reaction (before making the saving throw) to move up to your speed in a straight line toward that creature. If the target is within 5 feet of you at the end of this movement, you can also make two weapon attacks against it: one with each scimitar. For each attack that hits, you gain a +5 bonus to the saving throw against becoming frightened.

### Wand of Entombment
Wand, very rare (requires attunement)

This wand's bone handle is connected to a large coffin nail by a rigid chain. The wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

Detect Undead. You can use an action to hold the wand out in front of you and expend 1 of its charges. When you do, the wand's chain goes slack, and remains slack for 1 hour or until you end the effect using a bonus action. For the duration, the nail magically levitates and points in the direction of the nearest undead creature within 120 feet of you. If you use any of the wand's other properties while its chain is slack, it snaps back to normal for as long as it takes to use that property.

Disintegrate. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 4 of its charges to cast the disintegrate spell from it (save DC 15).

Entombing Nail. While holding the wand, you can use an action to send out two nails of pure necrotic energy, targeting a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack for each nail against the target, using a spell attack bonus of +7. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 necrotic damage, and its speed is reduced by 5 feet for 1 minute. If this attack reduces a creature's speed to 0 feet, it can't speak for the duration. An affected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns; on a success, the effects of any nail on it ends. You can send out additional nails by expending 1 or more charges as part of using this property, sending out one additional nail for each charge you expend. This penalty to speed is cumulative.

### Freezing Gauntlets
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

When not worn, these gauntlets appear to be simple iron cuffs. Once worn, however, creeping plates of crystalline ice form from beneath the metal to encase your arms and hands in icy gauntlets. While wearing the gauntlets, you have resistance to cold damage, and any target you hit with them as part of an unarmed strike takes an extra 1d4 cold damage. Alternatively, frost creeps up the metal of any weapon you're holding. If you hit a target with a metal weapon, that target also takes an extra 1d4 cold damage from the attack.

Cone of Cold. While wearing the gauntlets, you can use an action to hold your hands out and cast the cone of cold spell from them (save DC 16). Whenever you cast the spell in this way, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance that this version of the spell permanently changes. When it does, the version of cone of cold cast by the gauntlets deals half as much damage, the size of its cone is halved, and once it's cast from the gauntlets, it can't be cast from them again until the next dawn.


### Spellforge Scabbard
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This teal leather scabbard is decorated with mithral emblems. While wearing it, you can use a bonus action to drag a weapon across the scabbard. For the next minute, the weapon glows with a faint blue aura, and you can use a bonus action to magically return that weapon to the scabbard, stowing it there. If the weapon was nonmagical, it also becomes magic and has a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls for the duration. The effect ends early if you use this property again.

The scabbard can magically hold any one weapon at a time, shunting the weapon into an extradimensional space while leaving its handle or similar end exposed and within your reach. Regardless of the weapon it's holding, the scabbard always weighs 2 pounds. Any sheathed weapon falls to the ground at your feet if your attunement to the scabbard ends or if you sheath a second weapon in it.

The scabbard has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you use the scabbard to grant a weapon a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls, you can choose to expend 1 of its charges to increase that weapon's bonus to +2 for the duration instead.

Alternatively, you can use an action to expend 1 of the scabbard's charges to draw any type of melee weapon out of the scabbard. The drawn weapon is spectral, remains for 1 minute, and has a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls. Any attack that hits with it deals force damage, instead of its normal damage type. You can use a bonus action to return the spectral weapon to the scabbard, and if the weapon would normally have the heavy property, it doesn't.

### Crossbow of the Flying Fist
Weapon (crossbow, hand), uncommon (requires attunement)

The front of this weapon is carved in the likeness of a wooden fist. Crossbow bolts fired from this weapon deal either bludgeoning or piercing damage on a hit (your choice). If you deal bludgeoning damage to a target in this way, the crossbow bolt impacts the target without piercing it, leaving only a sizable welt or bruise behind. When this happens, you can also choose to have a mage hand appear at the target's location, as if you had cast the spell, provided the target was within 30 feet of you. You can use a bonus action immediately after the attack to control the hand.

This version of the mage hand spell can be used to punch a target within 5 feet of it whenever you control it, using a spell attack bonus of +5. On a hit, the hand deals 1 force damage.

### Incendiary Caltrops
Wondrous item, uncommon

These caltrops contain a magical heat source at their center. A set of incendiary caltrops comes with 1d6 + 6 magic caltrops when found. You can use an action to throw any number of these caltrops in an unoccupied 5-foot square on the ground that you can see within 15 feet of you. When you do, roll a number of d4s equal to the number of caltrops thrown and record the total. When a creature steps into that space, it must immediately make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. The caltrops then explode, and that creature takes an amount of fire damage equal to the total rolled on the d4s on a failed save, or half as much fire damage on a successful one. Once a caltrop has dealt this fire damage, it becomes a nonmagical caltrop.


### Time Warden Armor
Armor (breastplate), very rare (requires attunement)

This silver and brass breastplate is adorned with subtle clock designs. While wearing this armor, you are immune to the slow spell and don’t suffer the negative effects of haste when it ends on you.

When you roll initiative while wearing this armor, use the number rolled on the d20, before adding any modifiers, to determine which of the following effects occur:
1-5 | Any attack roll made against yo ubefore the start of your second turn of combat is made with Disadvantage.
6-15 | You add 1d12 to the total of your initiative.
16-20 | At the start of your first turn, you can use a Bonus Action to take the Dash action. If you take the Attack action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that Attack action. You make this additional attack roll with advantage.

### Staff of Awakening
Staff, artifact (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

This fey staff's shaft is hewn from the wood of an ancient, mysterious oak in the Ebony Glade, whose roots are said to have absorbed the dreams of elves from long ago. A perfect sphere of amber from that same oak hangs suspended in the center of it. While attuned to the staff, you are immune to the dream and sleep spells.

Charges. The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the staff's last charge and are not fey or lack the Fey Ancestry trait, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff disappears into a dreamlike mist and returns to the Ebony Glade in the realm of the fey.

Sleep. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the sleep spell from it. This version of the spell uses 3d8 to determine the maximum number of hit points for the spell, but targets a single creature within the spell's range instead. You can use the staff to cast the normal version of the spell at 1st level by expending 2 or more of its charges in this way, instead. For every 2 charges you spend after the 2nd, the level of the spell increases by 1.

Destroying the Staff. The only way of destroying the Staff of Awakening is to leave it in the workshop of the Grephearon, where its artisans untangle the dreams from which its originating oak grew. Doing so takes 1 year, after which the staff can be broken like a normal branch.

Dormant Properties. Some properties of this artifact are locked behind layers of dormant magic. As you grow stronger and reach certain milestones, these properties may become available to you.

(Prerequisite: 5th level) Nightmare. This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that deals an extra 1d8 psychic damage to any creature it hits. When you fail to put a creature to sleep with a sleep spell cast from the staff, that creature takes an amount of psychic damage equal to half the spell's remaining hit point total.

(Prerequisite: 5th level) Rested. While attuned to the staff, the amount of time you need to finish a long rest is halved, down to a minimum of 4 hours.

(Prerequisite: 9th level) Dream Walker. Sleep spells you cast roll an extra die when determining the spell's total number of hit points. In addition, you can reroll any 1 or 2 you roll on the spell's dice. You must use the new roll.

You can cast the dream spell from the staff, using your spell save DC, even if you're asleep or in a trance. You don't need to be holding the staff to cast the spell in this way, although it must be within 30 feet of you, and you must be the messenger of the spell. If you finish the spell and wake up, the staff immediately loses 5 charges, up to the maximum it has remaining. If you remain asleep or in a trance until you finish a long rest, it doesn't lose any charges. This version of the spell can't make the messenger appear monstrous to the target.

(Prerequisite: 13th level) Awaken. While holding the staff, you can cast the awaken spell from it, without any material components. To do so, you must use the spell's normal casting time and trace the spell's magical pathways into the staff's amber sphere. The lines vanish at the end of the spell. Once this property of the staff has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.

This part of the Awaken property is only discovered when a legend lore spell is cast on the staff: the version of the awaken spell cast by the staff can be used on itself, revealing additional properties. The Staff of Awakening gains the following properties once the awaken spell has been cast on it from the staff.

Sentience. The Staff of Awakening is a sentient chaotic good staff with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 19, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet; it can also see invisible creatures within that range. The staff communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common, Elvish, and Sylvan. While you're attuned to it, it can communicate with you as long as you're within 30 feet of it.

Personality. The Staff of Awakening is dreamlike in its whims and wishes, and it always seems to be partially distracted. While you're attuned to it, the staff can also appear in your dreams, during which time it is exceptionally coherent and insightful. It loves nothing more than analyzing the dreams of other people and imagining far-flung scenarios.

Dream Aura. While holding the staff, you can use an action to create an aura of dreams, which extends from you in a 40-foot radius. When a creature starts its turn within the aura with fewer than half its maximum hit points remaining, it immediately regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier if it's friendly to you, or takes psychic damage equal to that amount instead if it's hostile. The aura remains for 1 minute or until you end it early (no action required). Once this property of the staff has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. Alternatively, you can use an action to expend 10 charges from the staff to use this property again.

Improved Nightmare. When you hit a creature with the staff, you can expend 1 of its charges to deal an extra 2d8 psychic damage to the target.

Increased Charges. The staff's maximum number of charges increases to 20; it regains 1d10 + 10 expended charges daily at dawn, instead of all of them. In addition, if you expend its last charge, you don't need to roll a d20 if you aren't fey or lack the Fey Ancestry trait.

Plane Shift. You can use an action to expend 7 charges from the staff to cast the plane shift spell from it, using the staff as the tuning fork for the spell. When cast in this way, creatures targeted by the spell are transported to the Ebony Glade on the plane of the fey. If the spell is cast while you're on that plane of existence, the targets are instead transported back to wherever the plane shift spell was last cast before bringing creatures to the Ebony Glade. Alternatively, you can expend 7 charges to magically teleport you and up to eight willing creatures linking hands to the location where you last finished a long rest, provided that you're on the same plane of existence.

Premonition. When you start a long rest, you can focus on a question about an upcoming event that can be answered with either "good" or "bad." If you fall asleep during that rest, you learn the answer to the question at the end of the rest. At the GM's discretion, any dreams you have during that rest may reflect details of the event. This property doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of spells or the loss or gain of a companion.

Psychic Resistance. While holding the staff, you have resistance to psychic damage.

### Bastion Chain
Armor (chain mail), rare (requires attunement)

The chains of this armor shift naturally with your movements. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor, which doesn't impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make. In addition, the chains flow around you reflexively when you're surrounded; the armor's bonus to AC increases to +2 when three or more hostile creatures are within 5 feet of you.

### Shadow-Fletched Arrow
Weapon (arrow), rare

This arrow is barbed with unforgiving spikes and releases a plume of magical shadow when shot. When a creature is hit by the arrow, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A creature's Strength score is reduced by 2d4 for 1 hour on a failed save, or by half as much on a successful one. This effect can't reduce a creature's Strength score below 6. The arrow then becomes nonmagical.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as shadow-fletched bolts meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.

### Mimic's Smilemaker
Wondrous item, common

This bone-handled brush can clean your teeth exceptionally well, resulting in magically fresh breath with every use. You can clean your teeth using the brush over the course of 1 minute. Parts of a mimic's tongue are used to make a comfortable grip and scrubber. The brush creates its own frothing cleaning solution when it's used.

Your teeth are magically transformed into fangs whenever you finish cleaning your teeth with the brush, and they remain transformed in this way until you finish a long rest. In addition, your tongue becomes stained blue and purple for the duration.

### Bullseye Dart
Weapon (dart), rare

The weighted end of this dart is made to resemble a stylized eye, and its shaft is hewn from a bull's horn. Your attacks with this magic weapon score a critical hit on a roll of 16–20. Once this happens, the dart loses this property for 1 minute. In the meantime, it can still be used as a magic dart.

### Magmarath Molten Blaster
Weapon (crossbow, heavy or light), very rare (requires attunement)

Molten veins glimmer from beneath this magic weapon's volcanic body. The crossbow magically creates and loads its own ammunition whenever the drawstring is pulled back, forming a bolt of condensed lava each time. On a hit, it deals 2d8 fire damage, instead of the weapon's normal damage. You still add your Dexterity modifier to this damage roll. The ammunition crumbles and turns to ash immediately after it hits or misses a target or if it's removed from the crossbow.

The crossbow has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the crossbow, you can expend 1 of its charges using an action. When you do, the crossbow magically projects an explosive mote of fire, which vaguely resembles a fiery mephit. If the last target you hit with one of the crossbow's lava bolts is still within the weapon's normal range, the mote magically strikes that target and explodes. Roll 4d6. The target takes fire damage equal to the total, and each creature within 10 feet of the explosion (not including the target) must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take fire damage equal to half the total.

### Solar Torch
Rod, very rare (requires attunement)

While holding this rod, you can use a bonus action to cause a Tiny sun to float above it. The sun sheds bright light out to 30 feet, and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight. If any of the bright light overlaps with an area of magical darkness, it suppresses that effect in the area (but does not dispel it), allowing creatures to see as normal within the bright light's radius.

Sunburst. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast the sunburst spell from it (save DC 16), centered on you. You take no damage from the spell when cast in this way, but are still blinded if you fail the saving throw. Each time the rod is used to cast this spell, there is a 50 percent chance that the rod loses this property. When that happens, the rod no longer requires you to be attuned to it in order to use its properties.

### Ashen Bloom
[TODO] this is cool, or the petals are for sure as consumable
Wondrous item, rare

An ashen bloom is a rare flower that grows in earth that's been charred by a phoenix's fire. Once it blooms, it continues to live indefinitely until all of its petals are removed, even if it's plucked from the soil. When found, an ashen bloom has 2d4 + 2 petals remaining. The flower crumbles to ash once its last petal is removed.

Its petals have a variety of uses. You can pluck one of its petals as part of the options below. Once a petal has been used, it loses its magic.

Component. You can use one petal as part of casting a spell that deals fire damage. When you do, choose one creature that takes damage from the spell. That target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage.

Eaten. You can eat one petal using an action. When you do, you're cured of either one disease or one poison affecting you. If you're afflicted by more than one, you neutralize one disease or poison of your choice that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

Smoked. You can smoke one petal in a pipe or similar object over the course of 1 minute, at which time you gain resistance to fire damage for 1d4 hours. The exhaled smoke is red.

Steeped. You can steep one petal in 8 ounces of cold water over the course of 10 minutes, by which point the water is boiling and crimson. Drinking all of this tea, which takes at least 1 minute, reduces your exhaustion level by one.

### Shroud of the Unburied
Wondrous item, rare

This canvas burial shroud is permanently stained red and is worn like a cloak. When you're reduced to 0 hit points while wearing the shroud but not killed outright, it magically wraps around you to protect your unconscious body. You immediately gain 25 temporary hit points, which remain for 10 minutes or until you regain any hit points, at which point the shroud unwraps from you. While you have these temporary hit points, you can neither gain nor suffer any death saving throw successes or failures, and whenever a creature within 10 feet of you deals damage to you, it immediately takes 2d12 necrotic damage.

Once the shroud has granted temporary hit points in this way, it can't do so again until 3 days have passed. In the meantime, you must make a DC 5 Constitution saving throw whenever you finish a long rest. On a failed save, you gain only the benefits of a short rest, as you're plagued by horrific visions of long-dead spirits.

### Lionguard Chain
Armor (chain shirt or chain mail), rare (requires attunement)

This armor was once the standard equipment of elite guards for a now-fallen empire. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened, and you can add your proficiency bonus to any Charisma check with which you aren't already proficient when interacting with common guards or soldiers.

### Clangor Helmet
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This helmet was made from a temple bell and weighs 10 pounds. While wearing it, you have resistance to thunder damage and can't be deafened. In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you deals bludgeoning damage to you with a melee attack, roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, the attacking creature takes 5 or 6 thunder damage, respectively.

### The Timekeeper's Pendulum
Weapon (greataxe), legendary (requires attunement)

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding it, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word. When you do, you are affected by the haste spell, which lasts until the start of your next turn. At the start of your next turn, roll a d20. On a 1–10, you are affected by the slow spell, or the haste spell on an 11–20. The spell lasts until the start of your next turn, at which point you roll the d20 again. Continue to roll the d20 at the start of each of your turns in this way for 1 minute, gaining the effects of either the haste or slow spell each turn, or until you end it using a bonus action. This property of the axe can't be used again until the next dawn.

In addition, when you roll a 1 or 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, you are immediately affected by either the slow or haste spell, respectively. The spell lasts until the start of your next turn; if you are already affected by one of the spells, it's replaced by this one for the duration.

These spells don't require concentration, but the effect ends early if you start your turn without holding the axe or if you're reduced to 0 hit points. Furthermore, you don't suffer the effects of the end of any haste spell from the axe.

Rewind. While holding the axe, if you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points but doesn’t kill you outright, you can use your reaction (before falling unconscious) to interrupt the current turn. You then immediately take an extra turn, and regain any hit points you lost since the end of your last turn, up to a maximum of 24 hit points. You are affected by the haste spell for the duration of this extra turn. Once this property of the axe has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Primordial Earth Heart
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)

This crystal-pierced rock is shaped like a heart. It gently pulses while held and is always slightly warmer than body temperature. It is said that the first earth elemental was once a human that joined with such a heart.

As part of attuning to the heart, you must also hold it to your chest. Once you've attuned to it, the heart magically sinks into your chest, with its crystals just barely visible above the surface. While attuned to the heart, your skin becomes hard like stone, granting you the effects of the stoneskin spell. In addition, while you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 14 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

Spells. While attuned to the heart, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 17): entangle, spike growth, or wall of stone. Each spell manifests as a series of jagged crystals. When a creature other than you enters the area of one of these spells (or within 5 feet of a wall of stone) for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature immediately takes 1d4 piercing damage from the jagged crystals. You are immune to the effects of the entangle and spike growth spells when cast in this way. Once the heart has been used to cast a spell, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.

Curse. This heart is cursed, and attuning to it extends that curse to you. While cursed, the stone and crystals spread across your body, gradually replacing your flesh with pure rock and crystal over the course of 30 days. After 30 days, you no longer need to breathe, you gain a burrowing speed equal to half your walking speed, and you have tremorsense out to a range of 10 feet. Your weight is also tripled; your swimming speed is reduced to 0 if you have one, and you sink to the bottom of any liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round, at which point you can walk as normal. Only a wish spell can end your attunement to the heart and remove the curse, at which point it erupts from your body, landing in a space within 5 feet of you and returning your flesh to normal.

### Ravenheart's Origami Ravens
Wondrous item, uncommon

This slim wooden carrying case holds three dark paper birds. While holding a paper bird, you can use an action to speak its command phrase, "By fold and feather, fly." When you do, the paper springs to life and transforms into a raven for 1 hour. For the duration, the raven is treated as if it were your familiar summoned by the find familiar spell. Its animal form can't be changed. The raven reverts to its paper form at the end of the hour, if it's reduced to 0 hit points, or if you dismiss it. When it does, it immediately tears itself to tiny paper shreds and is destroyed.

### Armor of the Stone Citadel
Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)

This armor is made of stone and reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than 17, instead of 15. Castle-like crenellations run along the tops of the armor's various pieces. While wearing the armor, you can't be petrified, and you have a damage threshold of 10. In addition, if you are blocking a friendly creature enough to grant it half cover against an attack or hostile effect, that creature instead has three-quarters cover against it.

Living Citadel. While wearing the armor, you can use an action to transform into a Huge stone tower. The tower is a 15-foot-square that's 30 feet tall, centered on you. It resembles your head and upper torso, complete with a pair of powerful stone arms. If there isn't space for the tower, you don't transform, and the action (but not the use of this property) is wasted. Your equipment merges into this form when you transform and has no effect for the duration. For the duration, you use your normal senses, but your speed is reduced to 0. While in this form, you gain 100 temporary hit points and have an AC of 18, your damage threshold increases to 20, and you can't be moved or knocked prone. You are also immune to any spell or effect that would alter your form. You remain in this form for up to 8 hours, at which point you return to your normal form. You return to your normal form early if you lose all of these temporary hit points or if you end the effect using an action. While in this form, you can't cast spells, and your normal attacks are replaced by unarmed strikes using your massive stone fists. These unarmed strikes have a reach of 30 feet and deal 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. You can make two unarmed strike attacks on each of your turns when you take the Attack action, even if you can normally make more. Alternatively, you can use an action to hurl a boulder from your arm. The boulder is a ranged weapon attack with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. On a hit, it deals 6d8 bludgeoning damage. You are proficient with these attacks, which use your Strength modifier for their attack and damage rolls.

You can choose to contain any willing or unconscious creatures that would be in your space when you transform into the tower. Other creatures are pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the tower. When you revert to your normal form, any creatures within the tower reappear in the nearest unoccupied space. A door large enough for Medium creatures to enter the tower appears on the ground. Creatures of your choice can open the door easily, but any other creature must make a DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools or a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check to open it. The tower has no windows, but has two floors and a staircase connecting them inside.

Once this property of the armor has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. If you're reduced to 0 temporary hit points and revert to your normal form, it can't be used again until 1d6 + 1 days have passed, instead.

### Quiver of Seasons
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This slender quiver is decorated with a forest of silhouetted trees. You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to speak the quiver's command word to change its season, which also changes its color and design: Spring (green, trees with silver leaves), Summer (yellow, rays of silver sunlight), Autumn (orange, silver leaves falling), or Winter (blue, silver veins on trees).

The quiver has 8 charges and regains 1d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. When you make a ranged attack using a weapon to fire ammunition drawn from this quiver, you can expend 1 of the quiver's charges to infuse that ammunition with the quiver's seasonal magic. That ammunition gains the following benefits depending on the quiver's associated season:

Spring. The ammunition is wrapped by verdant brambles. On a hit, the brambles wrap around the target and deal an extra 1d10 piercing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the brambles until the end of your next turn. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach from the brambles on a success.

Summer. The ammunition is scorched by wildfire. On a hit, flames erupt from it that deal an extra 1d10 fire damage to the target. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take an extra 1d10 fire damage at the start of its next turn.

Autumn. The ammunition is touched by decaying fungus. On a hit, a cloud of sickening spores bursts from it that deals an extra 1d10 necrotic damage to the target. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of your next turn. This has no effect on undead or constructs.

Winter. The ammunition is covered in biting frost. On a hit, ice splinters outward from it that deals an extra 1d10 cold damage. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved until the end of your next turn. For the duration of this effect, it can't use reactions, and on its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, but not both. Regardless of the target's abilities, it can't make more than one attack during its turn for the duration.

The ammunition returns to normal after the attack.

Other types of magic ammunition containers of this kind exist, such as a bolt case of seasons meant for crossbows, though quivers are most common.

### Battlebrew Bomb
Wondrous item, uncommon

This fist-sized keg contains 1 ounce of extremely old dwarven liquor which is as strong as it is explosive. A built-in locking mechanism keeps the barrel sealed until it's ready to be used. You can use an action to twist the sides of the keg and throw it at a point that you can see up to 20 feet away from you, splitting the keg open on impact and spraying the area with a fine mist of the liquor. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 poison damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The next time that a target that was sprayed by the liquor takes fire damage within 1 minute, it takes an extra 2d8 fire damage as the liquor ignites.

### Spool of Shadow
Wondrous item, common

Thin wisps of smoke gently rise from this spool of magic black thread. You can use the entire spool of thread to repair an article of clothing or embroider a design on one instead. In either case, it takes 1 hour to sew the entire spool's thread on an article of clothing, at which point the thread's magic is transferred to it. While a creature is wearing the article of clothing, it can add 1d4 to the total of any Dexterity (Stealth) check it makes. Once this property has been used for a third time, its magic is lost.

### Ghostbow Bracer
[TODO] rework this for ghost hand control for mufi

### Steel Hawk Elite Lance
Weapon (lance), rare

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. As an action, you can thrust the lance in a direction to cause a line of powerful wind to erupt from the lance. The line is 5 feet wide and 30 feet long. Each creature in the line is buffeted by the wind and must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet in a random direction that's perpendicular to the line. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't pushed. You then fly up to 30 feet in a straight line in that same direction. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Once this property of the lance has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Silver Eagle Acolyte Robe
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

This robe is worn by religious and administrative members of the Silver Eagle Forge Coalition. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws you make while wearing this robe. In addition, whenever you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage or disadvantage and roll the same number on both d20s, you can combine the two rolls and use their sum as the result. If a combined result would equal 20 or higher, it is instead treated as a 20, but is not treated as a critical hit or critical success.

### Faerie Firework Launcher
Weapon (crossbow, light or heavy), rare (requires attunement)

This crossbow's wood shifts from golden yellows to vibrant reds and has a dimly lit fuse at its top. It has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend 1 of the weapon's charges once on each of your turns when you make a ranged attack roll with it. When you do, the bolt sizzles and sparks with festive colors, and whistles loudly as it flies through the air. On a hit, the target takes an extra 2d10 fire damage. Hit or miss, the bolt then explodes in an eruption of magical fireworks. The target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 fire damage and be under the effects of the faerie fire spell until the start of your next turn (no concentration required). The whistling bolt and firework's explosion can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. The bolt is then destroyed, provided it wasn't magical.

### Protector's Ward
[TODO] this is cool for Nyari
Armor (shield), uncommon

This shield depicts a pair of knights reflected across its center. While holding this shield, you can use your reaction when a friendly creature that you can see within 15 feet of you is hit by an attack from a hostile creature. You then teleport to the friendly creature's space, pushing it 5 feet away from you to an unoccupied space of your choice when you do. You take the damage from the attack, even if the total of the attack roll doesn't meet or exceed your AC. Once this property of the shield has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Gauntlets of the Divine Feud
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric)

These paired gauntlets are the last remnants of a conflict between ancient rivals, one a holy warrior and the other a grim zealot, and remain linked by their feud. You have a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while wearing these gloves.

The gloves have a total of 2 charges and regain 1 expended charge daily at dawn. While wearing them, you can use an action to expend 1 of the gauntlets' charges to cast either the harm or heal spell from them, using your spell save DC. Once you cast a spell from the gauntlets, it can't be cast in this way again until the next dawn. Alternatively, you can expend 2 charges as an action to cast both spells from the gauntlets at the same time. When you do, the spells each have a range of touch.

### Owlbear-Fletched Arrow
[TODO] these are probably okay as common too? 
Weapon (arrow), uncommon

This magic arrow is fletched with the feathers of an owlbear. When you use this arrow as part of making a ranged weapon attack against a creature that's behind half or three-quarters cover, that creature gains no benefit from that cover. If the attack hits, the target takes extra piercing damage equal to the bonus to AC that the target would have normally received from being behind cover. Once the arrow deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as owlbear-fletched bolts meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.

### Ravenous Ring
Ring, uncommon

While wearing this ring, you can use an action to transform your hand into a kraken-like maw and touch a creature within 5 feet of you. When you do, the creature must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Your hand then returns to normal. If the creature fails the saving throw, you also gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt. These temporary hit points remain for 1 minute. Once this property of the ring has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Hag's Claw
Weapon (dagger), legendary (requires attunement)

The metal of this wicked knife is said to be folded with the hair of a hag, giving it a dark, wave-like pattern that sizzles with corrupting magic. Its handle, curved like the blade, is made from long finger bones that ever-so-slightly curl to hold your hand.

You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with the dagger, it takes an extra 1d8 acid damage. If you had advantage on the attack roll, the target must also succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take an additional 1d8 acid damage and be poisoned until the end of your next turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature makes Constitution saving throws with disadvantage. If you reduce a Small or larger hostile creature to 0 hit points with this weapon, you gain the benefits of the greater invisibility spell (no concentration required) until the end of your next turn.

Curse. This dagger is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the dagger, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using the dagger, there's a 10 percent chance that your appearance changes to more closely resemble the hag that was used to make the weapon. For example, your teeth show signs of decay, your laugh turns to a cackle, and your hair loses its color and grows stringy. Once this happens for a third time, you become possessed by the spirit of the hag: your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you regard your allies as manipulatable threats. You remain possessed by the hag until the curse ends.

A single remove curse spell (or similar magic) fails to end the dagger's curse if your appearance has begun to change as a result of it. For each time your appearance has changed in this way, an additional use of remove curse or similar spell must be cast within a 24-hour period in order to end the curse. Ending the curse returns your appearance to normal.

### Corvus Pyre
Weapon (quarterstaff), legendary (requires attunement)

This black cane is made of gnarled wood and has a silvered raven's skull at its top. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the finesse property, regardless of which form it's in.

While in its cane form, it functions as a quarterstaff. While holding it, you can use a bonus action to transform it into its scythe form. When you do, a large, shadowy sickle blade erupts from the raven's beak and the cane glows with fiery embers.

While in its scythe form, the weapon functions as a halberd that lacks the heavy property, although it's still considered to be a quarterstaff for the purposes of weapon proficiency. When you hit with an attack using the scythe, the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage. You gain temporary hit points equal to the fire damage dealt, which last until the start of your next turn. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, the creature takes 5 fire damage. The weapon remains in this form until you use a bonus action to transform it back into its cane form or until you drop or sheathe it. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using the scythe, you can choose to reduce it to ash. A creature with legendary actions can't be turned to ash in this way.

Death's Vigil. As an action, you can touch a corpse with the weapon to create a harmless, flaming mantle around it. The mantle duplicates the effect of the gentle repose spell, which lasts until this property is used again or until your attunement to the weapon ends. While protected by the mantle, a corpse has a damage threshold of 20, which means it has immunity to all damage unless it takes 20 damage or more from a single attack or effect, in which case it takes damage as normal.

Fate's Bond. While holding the weapon, you can use a bonus action to curse a creature that you can see with a grim fate. The curse remains for 1 minute or until the creature is reduced to 0 hit points. While cursed, your attacks with this weapon against that creature are made with advantage, and you magically know the exact distance and direction of the creature from you, provided that you're on the same plane of existence. This property of the weapon can't be used again until the next dusk.

If the curse lasts for its full duration, it rebounds; you take 4d10 fire damage, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way. If you're reduced to 0 hit points when this happens, your body is incinerated and turned to ash.

### Daemonomicon
Wondrous item, very rare

This leather tome is filled with demonic lore and occult secrets, which are written in Abyssal. You can spend 10 minutes reading through its pages to learn information about an aberration, demon, or cult. At the end of that time, make an Intelligence saving throw. The DC is equal to 10 + half the aberration's or demon's challenge rating (rounded up), or 16 if you used it to learn information about a cult. On a failed save, you take 4d6 psychic damage, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way, and learn nothing from the book. You have advantage on the saving throw if you're a warlock with an eldritch or fiendish patron. On a successful save, you learn up to three of the following pieces of information of your choice about an aberration or demon:
   
    Up to three of its ability scores of your choice
     
    Any damage resistances, immunities, or vulnerabilities it has
     
    Any condition immunities it has
     
    Its armor class
     
    Its hit point maximum
     
    Its challenge rating

Alternatively, if you read the book to learn about a cult and succeed on the saving throw, you have a +10 bonus to the next ability check you make to uncover such information related to the cult.

Curse. This book is cursed, and failing the Intelligence saving throw extends the curse to you. While cursed, you are unwilling to part with the book, keeping it within reach at all times, and you have disadvantage on attack rolls against aberrations and demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities. If you're a warlock, you also learn the following spells, which don't count against the number of spells you know: banishment, bestow curse, hellish rebuke, and scorching ray. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells, which you know for as long as you remain cursed. If you have a Book of Shadows, this book replaces it, and whenever you have to make an Intelligence saving throw when reading the book, you can make a Charisma saving throw instead.

### Cathedral Armor
Armor (breastplate), very rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)

The front of this magic armor is covered in a panel of stained glass. Attuning to the armor causes the design of the glass to change to depict your deity, oaths, or similar divine order. You have a +2 bonus to AC while wearing this armor.

While wearing the armor, you can use an action to cast the prismatic spray spell from it, using your spell save DC. Alternatively, you can cast this spell as part of using your Channel Divinity. The Channel Divinity must require an action to use, and you choose whether the spell is cast before or after the effects of the Channel Divinity resolve. If your deity is aligned to a particular damage type, such as fire or lightning, you can choose that damage type's respective color, instead of rolling a d8 to determine it, as part of casting the spell from the armor. The armor can't be used to cast this spell again until the next dawn.


### Stinkbug Shield
Armor (shield), uncommon

This shield is designed in the likeness of a brass stinkbug with green accents. While holding it, you can use your reaction when you're hit by a melee weapon attack to release a gaseous plume of stinking fog from the shield. The attacker must immediately succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or spend the rest of its action and bonus action retching and reeling. A creature that doesn't need to breathe is immune to this effect, but a creature with a trait that grants them advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell has disadvantage on the saving throw. This property of the shield can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Corsage of the Hidden Thorn
Wondrous item, uncommon

This corsage is teeming with all manner of verdant plant life. Four roses decorate the corsage, whose colors and arrangement can be magically changed using an action while wearing it. You always smell of fresh plants and roses while wearing the corsage.

You can remove a rose from the corsage as if you were unsheathing a weapon. When you do, the rose's stem magically extends from the flower, transforming into a long thorn at its tip. The rose is considered to be a +1 dagger and can't be returned to the corsage once removed. If a removed rose is more than 5 feet away from the corsage at the end of a turn, it withers and becomes an ordinary dead rose.

The corsage regrows 1d4 missing roses daily at dawn.

### Mercenary's Pauldron
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

This magic pauldron has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. You can use a bonus action while wearing the pauldron to expend 1 of its charges to divine its tactical insights, magically granting you advantage on the next weapon attack roll you make before the end of your next turn. On a hit, the attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type, and you gain that same amount of temporary hit points, which last until the end of your next turn.


### Hide of the Wild Guardian
[TODO] this is very cool but probably too strong for a while
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a druid)

This well-worn gray bearskin cloak has been passed down from druid to druid for generations. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:
     
    You gain a +1 bonus to ability checks and saving throws.
     
    You can use your Wild Shape feature up to three times between rests, instead of twice, unless you can already use it more.
     
    The maximum challenge rating beast you can transform into with your Wild Shape increases by 1.
     
    While transformed into a beast, you gain a +3 bonus to AC, as well as to attack and damage rolls with natural weapons, even if the cloak merges into your new form.

### Husk
[TODO] rare or very rare for Kal.
Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement by a druid)

While holding this shield, you have a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. When you use your Wild Shape druid feature to turn into a Beast, the segments of this shield magically reassemble over your new shape to form an insectoid exoskeleton. Your new form gains a +3 bonus to its AC.

One With the Swarm. As an action while holding the shield, you can cast the insect plague spell centered on yourself. When cast from the shield, the spell only affects creatures of your choice, and it moves with you for the duration. Additionally, when you take damage while this spell is active, you can use a reaction to command the insect swarm to shield you and halve the damage taken. Each time you use this reaction, the damage that insect plague deals is reduced by 2d10. The spell ends if its damage is reduced to 0d10. Once One With the Swarm has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn unless you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher (casting insect plague at the level of the spell slot expended).

Moonlight refracted off of the green-black carapace of the monster as it burst from the treeline. Its roar sent shivers down my spine. Our logging camp had beefed up defenses in response to warnings from the locals. “A druid protects this forest” they said… but this thing must’ve tore itself straight from hell. I saw snow-white fur beneath its serrated armor. A pair of antennae protruded from its head bedecked with six unblinking eyes. Its maw and claws were ursine. We launched a last-ditch volley of arrows at it, but they clattered against its shell to no effect. The beast smashed through our meager palisade in the blink of an eye. We turned to run, but the bug-bear was too quick. It destroyed my comrades with horrid savagery. As quickly as the carnage started, it was over. The monster pinned me down with one bloody paw, large as my chest, and it spoke this message to me “I am Ursius, I speak for the trees. Defile this land again and your blood will quench its roots. Flee now, and tell the others what fate befell you here.”

### Prayer Beads of Protection
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

When you finish a long rest while wearing these beads, the beads cast the sanctuary spell (DC 13) on you. The spell lasts for 24 hours or until you break it.

### War Banner of the Tactician
Rod, very rare (requires attunement)

Unless you are incapacitated, while you hold this banner in one hand, you inspire nearby allies. Each friendly creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of you that can see the banner gains the effects of the freedom of movement spell until the start of their next turn.

Tactical Maneuver. When an enemy creature moves within 5 feet of a friendly creature that can see or hear you, you can use your reaction to direct your ally to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Runic Axe of the Sunderer
[TODO] make this a warhammer for Nyari
Weapon (greataxe), very rare (requires attunement)

This brutal adamantine greataxe has the rare giant “Sunder” rune engraved into it. An accumulation of brittle shale coats the axe and jagged stone shards float around the exposed axehead. When a creature attunes to the axe, its size changes to suit the attuned creature. In its non-attuned state, the axe is large enough for a Huge giant to wield. You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Shatter Strike. When you hit a target with this axe, you can cause the shale accumulation to shatter explosively (no action required). Each creature within 10 feet of you (excluding yourself) must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that is wearing armor or a shield that has been sundered by this axe’s Sunder Rune makes this save with disadvantage. Each creature takes 8d4 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this property of the axe has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Sunder Rune. You can only activate this rune if you have a Strength score of 17 or higher. When you score a critical hit with this weapon, and the target is wearing armor or wielding a shield, you can activate the rune to sunder the target’s armor or shield (your choice). You can also activate the rune when you hit a suit of armor or shield with this weapon, and the target object isn’t being worn or carried. When you do so, the armor or shield takes a permanent and cumulative −2 penalty to the AC it offers. If the object is magical, it is immune to this effect. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed by this effect. Once activated, this rune can’t be used again until the next dawn.

### Aegis of Dawn
Armor (shield), uncommon

This shield has 3 charges, and it regains all expended charges daily at dawn. As a reaction when a Fiend or Undead creature hits you with an attack while you are holding this shield, you can expend 1 charge to cast the shield spell from it. When cast from the shield, the spell only protects against the attacks of Fiends and Undead creatures, and a barrier of radiance surrounds you, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

### Jumping Sabatons
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While wearing these sabatons, you can use your bonus action to jump to an unoccupied space that you can see, without provoking opportunity attacks. This jump costs movement as normal.

Leaping Tackle (requires attunement by a barbarian). When you jump with the sabatons, you can choose to land on a space occupied by a Large or smaller creature. Make a contested Strength check. If the creature fails the contest, it takes piercing damage equal to 2d4 + your rage damage bonus and is knocked prone. If the creature succeeds the contest, it suffers no damage or effect and you land in the nearest unoccupied space of your choice.

Surging Leap (requires attunement by a fighter). When you use your Action Surge class feature, you can jump with these sabatons as part of that extra action. This additional jump doesn’t use your movement; however, you can’t jump a distance farther than your full movement would allow. If you land within 5 feet of a creature, you have advantage on attacks against that creature until the end of your turn.

Once Leaping Tackle or Surging Leap has been used, neither property can be used again until you finish a long rest.

### Armor of Retribution
Armor (any medium armor), rare (requires attunement)

This armor has 5 charges, and it regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. When you take damage while wearing the armor, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and cause spectral bones to burst from your body, shielding you and impaling nearby enemies. You take half damage from the attack and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Shatterbolt
Armor (any medium armor), rare (requires attunement)

This armor has 5 charges, and it regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. When you take damage while wearing the armor, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and cause spectral bones to burst from your body, shielding you and impaling nearby enemies. You take half damage from the attack and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Cloak of the Condor
Wondrous item, common (requires attunement)

As a reaction when you fall while wearing this cloak, you can cast the feather fall spell, targeting only yourself. Once this spell has been cast from the cloak, it cannot be cast again until the next dawn. Roll a d20 each time you cast the spell from the cloak. On a 1, the spell fails and the cloak permanently loses its magic.

### Crescent Pearl
Weapon (scimitar), rare (requires attunement)

The pearlescent blade of this scimitar glimmers like the moon and its lapis lazuli handle resembles a starlit night sky. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In darkness, the unsheathed blade of this sword sheds dim moonlight in a 10-foot radius. The sword has a number of charges equal to your proficiency bonus and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Lunar Flash. As a bonus action while wielding the sword, you can expend one charge to cast the misty step spell from it.

Cosmic Cleave. As a bonus action while wielding the sword, you can expend one charge to suffuse the blade with moonlight. The next target you hit with the sword before the end of your turn takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage.


### Baneblade
Weapon (any sword), uncommon (requires attunement)

Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with this magic sword you can curse it until the end of its next turn. Whenever the cursed creature makes an attack roll or a saving throw, the creature must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw. This curse has no effect on a creature under the effect of the bane spell. A remove curse spell ends this effect and grants the target immunity to the sword’s curse for 24 hours.

### Bandolier of Many Knives
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This leather bandolier has eight daggers sheathed in it. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with one of these magic daggers. A dagger removed (or thrown) from the bandolier vanishes at the end of your turn and reappears on the bandolier, unless you are wielding the dagger as a melee weapon. You can draw a dagger from the bandolier (no action required) as part of making an attack with it.

Fan of Blades. As an action while wearing the bandolier, you can throw all eight daggers at once. You must have a free hand to do so. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d4 + 8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this property of the bandolier has been used, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

### Pilum of Plummeting
Weapon (javelin), uncommon

Ethereal chains spring from anything this magical javelin hits, binding and tethering it to the ground. A creature hit by this javelin must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw, or its flying speed (if any) is reduced to 0 feet for 1 minute. An airborne creature affected by this spell safely descends at 100 feet per round until it reaches the ground or the effect ends. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Once the javelin hits a creature, it becomes nonmagical.

### Hammerstrike
[TODO] cool leadership style hammer for Nyari
Weapon (maul), rare (requires attunement)

This weighty maul is cast entirely of platinum and meticulously engraved with heroic scenes from Hammond Hammerstrike I’s past. You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In darkness, the head of this hammer glows a brilliant silvery light, creating bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. While the hammer is glowing, the engravings on its surface animate and act out scenes of mining, exploration, and battle.

Aura of Leadership. As an action, you can hold the hammer aloft to emit a 30-foot aura of emboldening radiance. Up to 6 creatures of your choice (including yourself) within the aura gain one Leadership die each, a d8. Within the next 10 minutes, a creature can roll their Leadership die and add the number rolled to any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. Each time a Leadership die is rolled, it decreases by one size (from a d8 to a d6 to a d4). Once a d4 Leadership die is rolled, it is lost. After this property of the hammer has been used, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

### Venomous Arrow
Weapon (arrow), rarity varies

The rarity of this magic ammunition is determined by the age of the scorpula stinger affixed to its tip. An arrow with a larval stinger is uncommon, juvenile is rare, and adult is very rare. The poisonous effects of this arrow are non-magical and cannot be dispelled or canceled by an antimagic field.

Larval. A venomous arrow tipped with a larval scorpula stinger has these properties:
 
    A creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 1d8 poison damage and must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can remake the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once it hits a target, the arrow is no longer magical and its venom is expended.

Juvenile. A venomous arrow tipped with a juvenile scorpula stinger has these properties:
     
    The extra poison damage increases to 3d8.
     
    The poison’s save DC increases to 15. A creature that fails this save by 5 or more is paralyzed until the poison ends.
     
    Scorpula Swarm. As an action, you can cast the insect plague spell (save DC 15) from the arrow by firing it at a point within 300 feet of you. When cast in this way, the spell deals poison damage instead of piercing. The arrow is destroyed when used in this way.

Adult. A venomous arrow tipped with an adult scorpula stinger has these properties:
     
    The extra poison damage increases to 6d8.
     
    The poison’s save DC increases to 16 and its duration increases to 10 minutes.
     
    The save DC for insect plague increases to 16 and it is cast as an 8th level spell.

### Entropic Arrow
Weapon (arrow), rarity varies

The rarity of this ammunition is determined by the type of gemstone embedded in its shaft. An uncommon arrow is chrysoberyl, rare is peridot, and very rare is emerald.

Chrysoberyl. An entropic arrow embedded with chrysoberyl has these magical properties:

    On a hit, this arrow deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. If the target is a creature, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.

Peridot. An entropic arrow embedded with peridot has these magical properties:
     
    The extra necrotic damage increases to 2d8.
     
    Enervating Cone. If you speak the arrow’s command word while firing it, the arrow shatters into a 30-foot-cone of negative energy. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become enervated for 1 minute. An enervated creature can’t regain hit points and it has disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls and checks. At the end of each of its turns, an enervated creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Conversely, undead creatures in the area are empowered by this effect, and gain advantage on attack rolls and Strength checks for 1 minute. The arrow is destroyed when used in this way.

Emerald. An entropic arrow embedded with emerald has these magical properties:
     
    The extra necrotic damage increases to 4d8.
     
    A target hit by this arrow must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be aged a number of years equal to half the necrotic damage it took, rounded down. This aging effect can only be reversed by a wish spell.
     
    Enervating Cone’s range increases to a 60-foot-cone and the save DC increases to 16.

### Luminous Arrow
Weapon (arrow), rarity varies

The rarity of this ammunition is determined by the metal its tip is made of. An uncommon arrow is steel-tipped, rare is mithril-tipped, and very rare is adamantine-tipped.

Steel. A luminous arrow tipped with steel has these magical properties:

On a hit, this arrow deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage to the target. The damage increases by 1d6 if the target is an undead or a fiend. An undead creature of CR 1 or lower hit by this arrow must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or immediately die and turn to ash. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.

Mithril. A luminous arrow tipped with mithril has these magical properties:
     
    The extra radiant damage increases to 2d6 for both the base and creature-type-specific instances.
     
    The CR increases to 2 and the save DC increases to 15.
     
    Illuminate. If you shoot the arrow straight upward, it creates a 60-foot-radius sphere of sunlight 30 feet above you for 1 minute. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet. The arrow is destroyed when used in this way.

Adamantine. A luminous arrow tipped with adamantine has these magical properties:
     
    The extra radiant damage increases to 3d6 for both the base and creature-type-specific instances.
     
    The CR increases to 3 and the save DC increases to 16.
     
    The radius of both bright and dim light for Illuminate increases to 120 feet, and the duration increases to 10 minutes.


### Chain Devil's Embrace
[TODO] maybe some crazy thing or Kazimir or Ayra
Armor (chain mail or chain shirt), very rare (requires attunement by a lawful creature)

This mass of chains slithers with sinister sentience, threatening to constrict anyone in reach. Each chain ends in a rusty hook or wicked blade, perfect for snaring and lacerating victims. Donning the chains as a suit of armor is an unpleasantly confining experience, but the living metal adjusts to provide ample protection and mobility to its wearer. You can choose to don it as a suit of chain mail or a chain shirt. You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor.

Infernal Oath. In order to attune to this armor, you must declare an oath that will bind you together. The oath can be any goal, set of rules, or moral tenet that you choose, however it must be clearly defined and actionable. If the oath is of sufficient clarity and importance, it appears in written form and must be signed in blood before it burns away.

Grasping Chains. The armor has 7 charges, and it regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. As an action while wearing it you can expend 1 charge to shoot out hook-tipped chains to ensnare a creature that you can see within 10 feet of you. Make an attack roll against the target with a +8 bonus. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 slashing damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, takes 1d6 piercing damage at the start of each of its turns, and you can’t use Grasping Chains.

Devilish Form. While wearing the armor, as a bonus action you can invoke its infernal essence for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain the following effects:
     
    Your skin turns blood red, your eyes glow like coals, and chains writhe across your body.
     
    Grasping Chains’ range increases to 60 feet. It deals an extra 2d8 fire damage when it hits a target.
     
    You are immune to fire damage.
     
    As a reaction when a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of you and you can see one another, you can create the illusion that you look like one of the creature's departed loved ones or bitter enemies. It must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its turn. Creatures that can see through illusions are immune to this effect.

Once you’ve used Devilish Form, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

Sentience. The Chain Devil’s Embrace is a sentient, lawful evil suit of armor with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision vision out to a range of 120 feet. The armor communicates telepathically to the creature attuned to it and can speak, read, and understand Infernal and Common.

A sadistic chain devil named Tyrastr lives within the Chain Devil’s Embrace. The armor yearns to inflict pain and tyranny on others. It doesn’t care what the beliefs of its wearer are, so long as they are enforced meticulously and transgressors are punished without mercy.

Curse. While wearing this armor, Tyrastr demands strict adherence to your oath. If you act contradictory to your oath or do not seize an opportunity to mercilessly pursue it, the chains constrict around you and you take 1d8 piercing damage. The damage increases by 1d8 with each subsequent transgression. If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you immediately die and your soul is sent to hell, where it is imprisoned by a chain devil warden.

Until your attunement to this armor ends, you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws while wearing any other armor.

### Iron Maiden
[TODO] lategame kazimir item
Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)

The interior of this suit of iron armor is lined with brutal spikes. Donning the armor is an excruciating procedure that binds it to your body by piercing your flesh. Your hit point maximum is reduced by a number equal to your character level. Roll a d100. If the number rolled is greater than your new hit point maximum, you immediately die and the attunement fails.

The armor suspends your lifeforce while you are imprisoned within it, and grows in power as your blood is spilled, feeding off of your agony to fuel its magic. While wearing the armor you gain the following benefits:

    You have a +1 bonus to AC.
     
    You are immune to exhaustion and the frightened condition.
     
    Death Howl. When damage drops you to 0 hit points, you can emanate a psychic wail of agony and drop to 1 hit point instead. Each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take psychic damage equal to the damage you took. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

While wearing the armor and you have fewer than half of your maximum hit points (rounded down), you gain the following benefits:

    The AC bonus increases to +2.
     
    Bloody Vigor. Once on each of your turns, when you hit with an attack or deal damage with a spell, you can deal an extra 2d8 damage to one of the targets. If the target is a creature, you gain temporary hit points equal to the extra damage dealt.

While wearing the armor and you have fewer than one quarter of your maximum hit points (rounded down), you gain the following benefits:
     
    The AC bonus increases to +3.
     
    The extra damage from Bloody Vigor increases to 4d8.

Curse. The armor cannot be removed unless this curse is broken via the remove curse or wish spell. If the armor is removed, the magic that sustained your mangled body ends. You immediately drop to 0 hit points and you have disadvantage on death saving throws for the next 1d6 days.

### Misty Shiv
Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement)

A chilling mist wafts from the blade of this dagger. The misty shiv has 3 charges, and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. As a bonus action you can expend one charge to cast the misty step spell from the dagger. Upon reappearing, the next attack you make with this dagger before the end of the turn deals an extra 1d6 cold damage on a hit.

### Puffbomb
[TODO] cool craftable grenade?
Wondrous item, rare

This 3-inch diameter spherical fungal sac is filled with poisonous spores that burst forth if disturbed.

You can use an action to throw the puffbomb up to 60 feet. The puffbomb bursts on impact, expelling a 10-foot-radius cloud of spores that lingers for 1 round. When a creature enters the cloud’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way is assaulted by hallucinations and paranoid delusions as if under the effect of the confusion spell. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

Alternatively, you can use an action to attach the puffbomb’s sticky end to a solid surface. A puffbomb set in this way will burst when a creature touches it by entering the space it occupies.

### Focusblade
Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)

You gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this sword equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). This sword has a number of charges equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down), and it regains all expended charges when you complete a long rest. When you attack with this weapon and miss, you can expend 1 charge to turn that miss into a hit.

### Titan's Greatbow
Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)

This massive longbow is bound together from a bundle of saplings. Runic enchantments engraved into metal rings along its limbs empower the wielder with the strength to wield it. The bow has a normal range of 200 feet and a long range of 800 feet, and you have a bonus to damage rolls equal to your Strength modifier or +2, whichever is higher.

Enlarging Arrow. The bow has 5 charges, and it regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. When you make a ranged attack with the bow, you can expend 1 charge to cause the arrow to grow to immense proportions in mid-flight. On a hit, the target takes an extra 2d8 piercing damage if it is in the bow’s normal range, or 3d8 if it is in the bow’s long range. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a successful DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. This arrow deals double damage to objects and structures. The arrow then reverts to its normal size.

### Coldhand
Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)

This iron band is ringed with frost and embedded with milky blue uncut larimar. The hand upon which you wear the ring is pale and ice cold to the touch. The ring has 3 charges, and it regains all expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend 1 charge while wearing the ring to do one of the following options:

Chilling Blow. When you hit a target with an unarmed strike or a melee weapon attack, the target takes an extra 2d6 cold damage and it must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or it can’t take reactions and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn.

Ice Javelin. When you take the Attack action, if your ring-wearing hand is free, you can replace one of the attacks with a special thrown weapon attack. As part of the attack, you summon a javelin made of ice and throw it at a target that you can see within range. The ice javelin uses the damage die and weapon properties of a typical javelin. Hit or miss, the javelin then explodes. The target of your attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 cold damage. If the attack hit, the target has disadvantage on this saving throw.

### Icebreaker
[TODO] rework for Nyari

### Rooting Arrows
Weapon (arrow), uncommon

Rooting arrows are a type of arrow created by militant druid circles and ranger conclaves. There are multiple types of these arrows, which are described below. After a rooting arrow's been fired from a bow as part of a weapon attack, it continues to grow until its effect occurs at the start of your next turn. Once the effect ends, the arrow withers away and is destroyed. If an arrow hits a target, it remains centered on the target until a creature within reach uses an action to remove it. If an arrow misses a target, it lands in a space at the GM's discretion.

Floral. This arrow grows into a beautiful, enchanting flower. When its effect occurs, each humanoid within 10 feet of the arrow must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, and it does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. On a failed save, the humanoid is charmed by the creature who fired it for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.

Ivy. This arrow grows into a writhing mass of vines. When its effect occurs, each creature within 5 feet of the arrow must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is grappled by the vine for 1 minute. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the vine (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the vine. On a successful save, a creature's speed is halved until the end of its next turn as it struggles against the vines.

Spruce. This arrow grows painful tree needles that burst from it when it finishes growing. When the effect occurs, each creature within 10 feet of the arrow must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Rod of Instant Pillars
Rod, uncommon

This rod looks like a miniature stone pillar. You can use an action to set it down in an unoccupied space on solid ground within 5 feet of you and speak its command word. The rod then expands upward, creating a vertical pillar made of stone in that space. The pillar is a 5-foot-diameter cylinder and grows upward to fill the available space, up to 20 feet tall. Regardless of its size, it always weighs 500 pounds while in its pillar form. A creature can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check, moving the pillar on a success. If the pillar is moved in any way, it magically returns to its normal rod form.

The pillar remains until it's moved. When you speak the rod's command word, you can choose the style, color, and apparent quality of the pillar it creates.

### Steel Hawk Handaxe
[TODO] Very cool throwable for Kazimir
Weapon (handaxe), uncommon

When you hurl this magic axe and speak its command word, choose up to 4 different creatures that you can see, recording the order in which you choose each one. The first target must be within the weapon's range; each subsequent one must be within 20 feet of the previous target. Make a ranged attack against each target using the handaxe, treating each one after the first as if the weapon was thrown from the previous target's space. Immediately after the last attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.

This property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the handaxe can still be used as a magic weapon.


### Bramble Token Cuff
[TODO] cool reward from Alenna
Wondrous item, uncommon

This green ear cuff magically grips and coils around your ear while you're wearing it. You can use an action to speak the cuff's command word and throw it on the ground at a point you can see within 30 feet of you. The cuff then shatters, destroying it, and immediately grows into a mass of twisting vines and thorns in one of the following shapes of your choice:

Circle. The thorns grow in a 20-foot-radius circle on the ground that's centered on the point where the cuff landed. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration, and when a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

Cone. The thorns extend in a 30-foot cone originating from the point where the cuff landed in a direction of your choice. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 piercing damage and is grappled for the duration. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach from the thorns on a success. Dealing 10 fire or slashing damage to the thorns (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much piercing damage and isn't grappled.

Cylinder. The thorns erupt into a towering pillar of scraggly vines. The pillar is a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder. If the space isn't large enough for the vines, they harmlessly grow to fit the space. A creature in the area of the cylinder when it appears is either pushed to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it or is lifted on top of the pillar (its choice).

Line. The thorns create a dense wall of bramble-like brush in a straight line up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 6 inches thick. A creature can move through the wall using an action to pull and fight through the tangled mass of painful thorns. When it does, the creature takes 2d8 piercing damage and can't move until the start of its next turn. Dealing 10 fire or slashing damage to the wall (AC 10) temporarily destroys a 5-foot-wide portion of it until the end of the turn, at which point it magically regrows.

The vines and thorns remain for 1 minute, at which point they decompose and turn to rich soil.

### Sun and Moon Shield
Armor (shield), common

This shield is embossed with personified sun and moon designs. The sun's eyes magically open between dawn and dusk, and the moon's eyes open between dusk and dawn. While holding the shield, you can use an action to cause the shield to shed bright light in a 20-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light is warmly colored while the sun's eyes are open, but cool while the moon's are. The light remains for 1 hour or until you use an action to end it.

### Mirrorlight Stinger
Weapon (any bow), rare

This bow is decorated with mirrorlight crystals, allowing it to recreate illusions of the arrows fired from it. When you take the Attack action using the bow, you can use a bonus action to make a special ranged weapon attack with it. This attack fires an illusory arrow from the bow, and on a hit, it deals force damage instead of piercing damage. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of this special attack, unless that modifier is negative. The illusory arrow vanishes immediately after the attack.

### H'rethi Cloak of Shielding
[TODO] on flavor for Kal
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This asymmetrical cloak is typically worn by desert nomads in place of more durable armor. Its woven fibers have been enchanted to be like the shifting sand of the desert, shrugging off extraordinary heat and devastating blows. While wearing the cloak, you have resistance to fire damage, and any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. The cloak also has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack (but before it deals damage), you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the cloak's charges to force that creature to reroll the attack. It must use the new roll.


### Ring of the Printless

### Glaive of the Forest Guardian
[TODO] alright weapon for Kal
Weapon (glaive), rare (requires attunement)

The blade of this weapon is made of clear green crystal, and has decorative vines and flora wrapping around its metallic haft. While the weapon is on your person, You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep. If you're a fey or have the Fey Ancestry trait, you can use an action to cast the plant growth spell from the weapon while you're holding it. Once the glaive has been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

    Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.
     
    You can't become lost except by magical means.

### Phoenix fan
[TODO] another smoke themed item for Ayra
Wondrous item, rare

This vibrant paper fan bears a gilded phoenix design and fire opals along its wooden clasp. The fan has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the fan, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 15, spell attack bonus +7): fire shield (4 charges), fog cloud (1 charge; the cloud is made of smoke), scorching ray (2 charges), or wall of fire (4 charges). Alternatively, you can use a reaction when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls to expend 1 of the fan's charges to cast the feather fall spell on up to five falling creatures within range.

You can cast these spells from the fan even if it doesn't have enough charges. When you do, there is a cumulative 20% chance that the fan is destroyed for each spent charge beyond the number of remaining charges in the fan. If the fan is destroyed in this way, the spell fails and the action to cast it is wasted, and the fan is consumed by flame as it turns to ash and is destroyed.

### Rod of the Scarecrow
[TODO] probably cool earyl farm related item? 
Rod, uncommon

This wooden rod has a small stuffed scarecrow head on its end. You can use an action while holding the rod to speak its first command word. When you do, the rod's head transforms into a full scarecrow and leaps from your hand, landing in an unoccupied space that you can see within 5 feet of you and balancing on the rod. The summoned scarecrow uses the zombie's statistics with the following changes:

    The scarecrow is a construct, instead of undead, and can't understand any languages.
     
    The scarecrow holds a farmer's sickle. It can use its action to make two attacks with its sickle (+3 to hit). On a hit, it deals 1d4 + 1 slashing damage.
     
    Small and Tiny beasts have disadvantage on attack rolls against the scarecrow.

The scarecrow obeys your mental commands (no action required by you) and takes its turn immediately after yours. If you don't issue any commands, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. The scarecrow remains for 1 hour or until it dies or you use an action to speak its first command word again. The scarecrow reverts to the rod form at the end of the duration.

You can use a bonus action to speak the rod's second command word. If you're holding the rod, each creature within a 15-foot cone must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. Small and Tiny beasts have disadvantage on the saving throw. If the scarecrow is summoned when you speak the command word, each creature within 15 feet of it must make the saving throw instead.

Once a command word has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Coldfire Phoenix Draft
[TODO] cool late reward
Potion, legendary

This frigid potion is made from Everglacier ice that's been boiled by the flames of a phoenix. A single, downy phoenix feather rests inside the bottle, which has turned blue from the potion's magic.

When you drink this potion using an action, you gain resistance to cold damage until you die. When you die, you are immediately returned to life with 1 hit point and 100 temporary hit points. While you have these temporary hit points, you are immune to cold damage, your speed is halved, and you have disadvantage on ability checks.

### Amulet of the Lycanthrope
[TODO] Rework to be a bonus for shapeshifting for Kal?
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This rounded amulet depicts a harrowing crescent moon with blood-red claw marks running through its center. The markings emit a dim red light on the day of a full moon.

If you're not a lycanthrope, you can use a bonus action while wearing the amulet to assume a more bestial appearance, taking on the claws and defining features of either a bear, rat, tiger, or wolf (your choice). This transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you drop to 0 hit points or use a bonus action to revert to your normal form. For the duration, you can use your claws as natural weapons when making unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell for the duration of the transformation. This property can't be used again for 12 hours or until the next dusk, whichever comes first. Alternatively, if it's within 24 hours of a full moon, this property can be used again after 6 hours, instead of 12.

If you're already a lycanthrope and are wearing the amulet, your claw and bite attacks while in your animal or hybrid forms deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. In addition, your bite attack save DC increases by 3.

Curse. This amulet is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you have disadvantage on saving throws made to resist becoming cursed by lycanthropy.

### Cottage Chest
[TODO] Good reward for the whole group midgame  
Wondrous item, rare

This 1-foot-long chest looks like a replica of a woodland cottage and is magically locked. You can use an action to place this chest on the ground and speak its command word. The chest immediately unlocks and grows into a cottage that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the cottage is empty. When dismissed, the cottage returns to its normal chest form. If there isn't enough space for the cottage or there are creatures in its area when you speak the command word, the chest remains locked and the action is wasted.

The cottage is a wooden, two-story building that's 40 feet wide and 65 feet long. Inside is a kitchen, a dining room, and a large parlor with an ever-burning fire in its hearth. A curling stairway leads to the second floor, which has 4 bedrooms equipped with furniture you'd find in a modest to respectable inn. The first floor has six windows, and each bedroom on the second floor has one. When activated, the cottage has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.

The cottage's kitchen is filled with magical utensils that automatically stir, measure, and heat all manner of cuisine. Any check made using cook's utensils within the cottage has advantage on the roll. When left to its own devices, the cottage magically produces an array of baked goods for up to 8 creatures when the cottage appears for the first time each day and again each day at dawn until it is dismissed. Eating the food within the cottage provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day. If any baked goods are left uneaten, they vanish at dawn as the new goods appear. Any baked good, furniture, or similar object vanishes when taken outside the cottage and immediately reappears inside.

Further, fey and fiends can't enter the cottage unless you choose to let them, and creatures can't move or travel into it using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.

The cottage is made of wood and plaster, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over or moved. The roof, the door, and the walls (including the windows) each have 60 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the cottage (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain all its hit points.

Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage and falls prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn instead. Once this property has been used, it cannot be used again until next dawn.

### Flanker's Bow

Curse. If you eat the flesh of a humanoid with this cutlery, you become cursed with an insatiable hunger for humanoid meat.

This hammer has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges each day at dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 or more of the hammer's charges to slam it into the ground and transform the area around you into sickly, swamp-like terrain that remains for 1 minute. When you do, choose a space within 5 feet of you. You create a swamp that fills that space and adjacent spaces in a 5-foot radius with a thick muck up to 1 foot deep. For each additional expended charge after the first, the radius of the swamp increased by 5 feet. This area is considered difficult terrain. While you're holding the hammer, you can traverse the magical swamp as if it were normal terrain.

If you expend the last charge from the hammer, roll a d20. On a 1, the hammer turns to a viscous muck in your hands and is destroyed.

This version of the spell doesn't require concentration and deals no damage to any creature that succeeds on the saving throw when it appears; such a creature is instead pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). The wall remains for the duration of the spell or until this property of the hammer is used again.


### Spiker and Striker
[TODO] Cool Kazimir item
Weapon (dagger and warhammer), rare (requires attunement)

This warhammer and nail-like dagger share a magical bond. Despite being a pair of weapons, they are considered to be a single item for the purposes of attuning to them. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons. While wielding only the warhammer or both it and the dagger in either hand, the warhammer also has the light property.

When you hit a target with Spiker (the dagger), you can choose to leave the weapon embedded in the target. The first time you hit that target using Striker (the warhammer) while the dagger is embedded in it, the target takes an extra 1d12 piercing damage from the attack. The dagger then magically returns to your hand. It returns early if you don't deal this extra damage before the end of your next turn or if a creature uses an action to remove it from the target. If you don't have a free hand when Spiker returns to you, it lands at your feet instead.


### Shield of Yggdrasil
[TODO] cool for Nyari
Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)

You must have a Strength of 17 or higher in order to wield this massive, magical tower shield. The shield is of dwarven make and functions as a small battlement, granting you an additional +1 bonus to your AC while you wield it. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.

Shield plant. As a bonus action, you can plant this shield on the ground to barricade yourself behind it, granting you half cover against ranged attacks from the direction you’re facing. While you wield the planted shield, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage you take from nonmagical weapons is reduced by 3, but your movement speed becomes 5 feet. You can uproot the shield to end this effect as an action.

You can doff the shield when planting it by using an action to do so instead of a bonus action. The shield magically remains upright and in place and can be used as half cover to any creature standing immediately behind it in the space it was left in. The shield falls down when you fall unconscious or when knocked over following a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. You can move the shield while it’s planted by donning the shield again.

This shield has 3 charges and regains all expended charges each day at dawn. You can expend 1 charge when you plant this shield or later on a subsequent turn as a bonus action to send out metal roots along the ground in a 10-foot radius, centered on the shield. Enemy creatures treat this area as difficult terrain. Moving the shield also moves the roots. The roots remain until you uproot the shield or it falls over. 

You can choose to use an action instead of a bonus action in order to plant the shield while doffing it. While planted on the ground and unworn, any magical roots around the shield remain in place, and any creature immediately behind the shield has half cover from incoming projectiles.

These flames shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. While the hammer is lit, it deals an additional 1d8 fire damage to any target it hits and ignores resistance to fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word “quench,” or until you drop or stow the hammer.

Smith's Blessing. You can use the hammer to cast either the creation or fabricate spell using an action instead of its usual casting time. Creation is cast as a 6th level spell when cast in this way, and its conjured materials can be used as materials for the fabricate spell, although the materials still have a limited duration. Once the hammer has been used to cast a spell in this way, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the following dawn.

In addition, you know the mending cantrip if you don’t already know it while you’re attuned to the hammer. Mending’s usual size restriction is increased to 5 feet in any dimension for you when you use it to repair metal. Ability checks you make using smith’s tools to make or repair an item are made with advantage when you use the hammer’s head as the anvil.

If it succeeds, its movement speed is halved until the end of its next turn instead. 


### Cloak of Daggers
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

This asymmetrical cloak has a ring of silver daggers along its bottom hem. While wearing the cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while in dim light or darkness.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to summon a magic silver dagger to one or both of your hands, provided that they're empty. Each dagger disappears in a puff of smoke after 1 minute or at the end of your turn if you aren't holding it.

### Spiderbite Daggers
Weapon (dagger), rare

These daggers are made using the harvested fangs of a large venomous spider. When you hit the same target on your turn with each dagger, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take an extra 2d4 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn.

### Pick and Pocket
Weapon (dagger), rare

This brass and steel dagger can also be used as part of a set of thieves' tools when picking locks. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, as well as on any ability check you make using thieves' tools to pick open a lock, provided you use the dagger as part of the set of tools.

While holding the dagger in one hand and a small enough object in another, you can use an action to speak the dagger’s command word and twist it in the air as if it were a key. When you do, the object is shunted into a special demiplane, where it remains until you either twist the dagger in the opposite direction on your turn (no action required) or until you’re no longer holding the weapon. If you have a free hand, the stored object reappears in it when the object leaves the demiplane. Otherwise, it reappears at your feet. The demiplane can only store one object at a time, which must be no more than 1 foot on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds.

### Devil's Backbone
Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement by a warlock)

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon. While attuned to this sword, you have proficiency with it.

Bone Lance. The spinal segments of the blade launch forward, connected by stretchy sinew, to impale your enemies. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a Bone Lance. Make a melee spell attack against a target that you can see within 30 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 Piercing damage, and if it is Large or smaller, you can pull it up to 25 feet closer to you. You can use this property a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once) and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

Ossuary Armor. While attuned to this sword, you gain the Fiendish Vigor eldritch invocation. A suit of boney armor grows over your body when you use this invocation.

The spine of a bone devil is a powerful reagent for nefarious craftsmanship. Some semblance of unlife still lurks within it, anguished by its diminished state. For a fleeting moment, the tortured fiend feels vile satisfaction when its new form is used to inflict pain. To this end, it will help even a virtuous wielder strike true.
