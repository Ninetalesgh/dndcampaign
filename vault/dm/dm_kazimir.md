**Deathless Nature.** You don't need to breathe, you are immune to [Choking](vault/conditions.md#choking) and [Suffocating](vault/conditions.md#suffocating).

**Need for Blood.** You have a pool of 3 Blood Points. You lose 1 Blood Point after each Long Rest (or at dawn if there was no rest), if you have no Blood Points you gain a point of Exhaustion instead. While you have no Blood Points Long Rests don't remove your Exhaustion. You can Consume Blood from a creature except from (Constructs, Plants, Undead, Elemental, Ooze), for every 5 HP you consume the creature gains a stack of Exhaustion and you lose one stack of Exhaustion or gain 1 Blood Point.
Whenever you hit an eligible creature that is Grappled, Restrained, or Incapacitated with a Melee Attack you can instead consume 5 HP of blood from that creature.
*Blood Infusion:* As a Bonus Action you can consume 1 Blood Point to grant you +1 to all STR, DEX and CON Checks and Saves and an additional 1d4 damage to your Melee and thrown Ranged Attacks for 1 minute
