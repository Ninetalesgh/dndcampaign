**Deathless Nature.** You don't need to breathe.

**Spider Climb.** You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, at 3rd level, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

**Vampiric Bite.** Your fanged bite is a natural weapon, which counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. You add your Constitution modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with this bite. It deals 1d4 piercing damage on a hit. While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you have advantage on attack rolls you make with this bite.
When you attack with this bite and hit a creature that isn't a Construct or an Undead, you can empower yourself in one of the following ways of your choice:
  - You regain hit points equal to the piercing damage dealt by the bite.
  - You gain a bonus to the next ability check or attack roll you make; the bonus equals the piercing damage dealt by the bite
You can empower yourself with this bite a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**Need for Blood.** You have a pool of [X] Blood Points. You lose 1 Blood Point after each Long Rest (or at dawn if there was no rest), if you have no Blood Points you gain a point of Exhaustion instead. While you have no Blood Points Long Rests don't remove your Exhaustion. You can Consume Blood from a creature except from (Constructs, Plants, Undead, Elemental, Ooze), for every 5 HP you consume the creature gains a stack of Exhaustion and you lose one stack of Exhaustion or gain 1 Blood Point. 
Whenever you hit an eligible creature that is Grappled, Restrained, or Incapacitated with a Melee Attack you can instead consume 5 HP of blood from that creature.
