**Deathless Nature.** You don't need to breathe.

**Spider Climb.** You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, at 3rd level, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

**Need for Blood.** You have a pool of 3 Blood Points. You lose 1 Blood Point after each Long Rest (or at dawn if there was no rest), if you have no Blood Points you gain a point of Exhaustion instead. While you have no Blood Points Long Rests don't remove your Exhaustion. You can Consume Blood from a creature except from (Constructs, Plants, Undead, Elemental, Ooze), for every 5 HP you consume the creature gains a stack of Exhaustion and you lose one stack of Exhaustion or gain 1 Blood Point. 
Whenever you hit an eligible creature that is Grappled, Restrained, or Incapacitated with a Melee Attack you can instead consume 5 HP of blood from that creature.
