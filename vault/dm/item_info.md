## Concoctions
At the end of every Long Rest, you can convert one Ingredient into a related Concoction with Tools.

Concoctions can be consumables (like Potions or Elixirs), weapon coatings, or throwables.

Concoction has some DC, depending on the circumstances it's easier or harder to brew. (access to a laboratory, etc.)

[TODO] Specify mechanics for finding out what concoctions an ingredient is good for?  

## Crafting
[TODO] Crafting Read as Written is kind of weird. so not sure I want to do it like that.

## Drink or Administer Potion
As a Bonus Action you may drink the potion yourself or administer it to a willing or [Unconscious](conditions.md#unconscious) creature to grant the stated effect.
If you spend an Action instead of a Bonus Action, you can choose the result of any dice rolled in the stated effect.

## Apply Weapon Coating
As a Bonus Action you may coat one weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. The weapon will have the stated effect as property for the stated duration.
Only **one** coating can be applied to a weapon at the same time.

## Throw Grenade
When you take the Attack Action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing the grenade.
You can throw anywhere within range 4 + STR of yourself. All creatures within the stated effect range are affected and must take a DEX Save (DC 8 + your DEX + your PB), suffering the effect according to the result of the Save. Objects always fail their DEX Save.

## Ship Info
- **Speed**: A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships can't move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and weighs 50 kg. 
- **Crew.** A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a crew of skilled hirelings (see Services) to function. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of ship. 
- **Passengers.** The number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate using hammocks. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A passenger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 GP per day. 
- **Damage Threshold.** See the rules glossary. 
- **Ship Repair.** Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and labor. If the repairs are made in a location where supplies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved.
## Tools
Each type of tools requires a separate proficiency. If you have proficiency with a tool, add your PB to any ability check you make that uses the tool. If you have proficiency in a skill that's used with that check, you have **Advantage** on the check too.

## Attunement
Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called **attunement**, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item.

Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.

Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a Short Rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this **can't** be the same Short Rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the Short Rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.

An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than **three** magic items at a time. Additionally, a creature can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can't attune to more than one ring of protection at a time.

A creature's attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 30 meters away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another Short Rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed.

## Weapon Properties
### Weapon +1
This weapon grants you +1 to both Attack and Damage Rolls. 
### Weapon +2
This weapon grants you +2 to both Attack and Damage Rolls. 
### Weapon +3
This weapon grants you +3 to both Attack and Damage Rolls. 

### Ammunition
You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

### Finesse
When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your STR or DEX modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

### Heavy
Small creatures have Disadvantage on Attacks with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

### Light
Whenever you take the Attack Action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack with a **different** light weapon as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. You don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative.

### Loading
Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

### Thrown
If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a Ranged Attack with the specified normal/far ranges. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.

### Two-Handed
This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

### Versatile
This weapon can be used with one or two hands. The specified damage roll is used when using two hands to make a Melee Attack. 

## Variant
Items with variants have different templates, the variant does not change once determined. *(A Fernian Ash Staff will always be a Fernian Ash Staff)*

## Modifiers
[TODO] Rules, but basically 1 modifier per item. item has to be mundane. only counts for weapons, armor, and shield?

#### Silvered Weapon
  An alchemical process has bonded silver to this magic weapon. When you score a **Critical Hit** with it against a creature that is shape-shifted, the weapon deals one additional die of damage.

### Uncommon

#### Adamantine Armor
  This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you're wearing it, any Critical Hit against you becomes a normal hit.

#### Adamatine Weapon
  This weapon or piece of ammunition is made of adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. Whenever this weapon or piece of ammunition hits an object, the hit is a Critical Hit.

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes.
If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.
