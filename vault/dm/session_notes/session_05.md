## The Council

[TODO] The Grand Factor is in liege with Zariel, trying to recruit souls for the army of hell.
- There is something interesting in The Crypt (demonic power or such) that the grand factor wants, hirelings will show up later in The Crypt. 


- [Borin Grathal](dm/npcs.md#borin-grathal).
- [Dain Elster](dm/npcs.md#dain-elster).

The players see:
1  a fashionable f-HUMAN textile trader
2  a scarred x-DRAGONBORN weapons trader
3  a silver-haired m-HUMAN head of the alchemists
4  a f-HALF-ELF spice, perfume & luxury trader
5  a m-DWARVEN brewer & liquor trader
6  a m-HUMAN transport & logistics
7  a f-GNOME glassblower & jeweler
8  a m-HUMAN moneylender & the de-facto head of the council **Ledgerhand**
9  a m-HUMAN grand factor of waukeen **Silan Thornvale**
10 **Borin Grathal**, head of the Academy
11 **Dain Elster**, count of New Arvandal

**Baroness Isolde Redmire.** -> A refined and shrewd textile magnate who controls the wool and dye trade. Always draped in the latest imported silks, she has an eye for fashion and finance alike.

**Gorva "Three-Scales" Durn.** -> A grizzled dragonborn metalsmith who oversees a lucrative arms and armor trade. Her nickname comes from an old forge accident that left three scale-shaped scars across her face.

**Magister Othric Venn.** -> A silver-haired human academic and head of the local alchemist’s guild, he argues for magical advancements in trade but is notoriously difficult to work with due to his pedantic nature.

**Velora Quinch.** -> A half-elf spice and luxury goods importer who has made a fortune in exotic teas, perfumes, and rare indulgences. Always smells faintly of cinnamon and wears jingling gold bracelets.

**Brenn Foremarsh.** -> A portly, good-natured halfling brewer who supplies the town’s finest ales. Has a booming laugh and a tendency to call everyone "my friend" before negotiating them into a terrible deal.

**Hendrik Karral.** -> A former mercenary turned logistics expert, he runs a shipping and caravan business. Pragmatic and unsentimental, he sees commerce as a battlefield where only the clever survive.

**Seraphine Lowind.** -> A gnome glassblower and jeweler, small in stature but large in presence. She commands respect with her sharp business sense and even sharper tongue.

**Jorvus "Ledgerhand" Pell.** -> A meticulous accountant and moneylender whose sharp mind has made him indispensable to the council. He wears wire-rimmed glasses and always seems to be scribbling figures in a notebook.

**Motivations**: 
- Academy staff kind of put off by the merchant's council
- Merchant's council wants to exert pressure on **Dain** to move The Guard towards the goblins
- Arms dealer, Alchemist and Logistics lean towards aggression, luxury goods traders rather towards diplomacy. Especially **Ledgerhand** doesn't like aggression, dead people don't pay back debts, after all.

- Mobilizing against the goblins means less guards in the Stockpile. **Tess** also likes this. **Teal** and **Dain** are invested in the Stockpile Encroachment.


## The Academy  

upper north east - cartography & exploration
Along the elevator: 
  upper south west - mechanics
  lower south west - stone works
median market side - diplomacy & commerce
upper cellars - arcane studies
lower cellars - alchemy medicine (laboratories)

- The canteen and lavatories on the entrance level, stairways and elevators lead to the lecture, laboraty, and library rooms.

- [Theron Windrunner](dm/arvandor/characters/living_npcs.md#theron-windrunner). Human -> The energy of a young adventurer. His sun-kissed skin reflects days spent in the wild. A faint scar across his left brow hints at a few early scrapes, but his boyish confident grin suggests he relished every moment. He wears a rugged, well-worn jacket over a practical tunic, and his utility belt is stocked with cartographer’s tools.
- [Elara Moonshadow](dm/arvandor/characters/living_npcs.md#elara-moonshadow). Elf -> Dark brown skin, silver white hair, dark blue, gold and white woven imposing dress. 

The library rooms are spread across the entire Academy, but the main halls are found in the lower floors easily reachable from the entrance hall and elevators. The Arcane Studies rooms are seated close to the big library.
[Animated Book (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#animated-book)
[Rug of Smothering (2)](dm/monsters.md#rug-of-smothering)

If desired, **Zara** or **Theron** appear here and greet the players or helps out if they are fighting the animated things. (they might frantically look for a solution for healing if someone is hurt in books on shelves?)
- **Zara** is interested in The Crypt and source of the necromantic magic and about the mine tunnels in lower Mithdral, she urged Theron to lead an expedition already.
- **Theron** is skeptic about the goblin attack being something superficial, he believes something bigger is going on. It's
- **Elara** desires a diplomatic approach to ensure flow of commerce, wants to strike deals with the antagonist authority.

### The Laboratories
- **Maris Tindle**: Halfling -> Serious expression, soft skin, shoulder long flowing black hair, black eyes, tools strapped on her waist and her chest wrapped in a tight vest.
 
- **Location**: Dimly lit by flickering sconces, the stone-walled laboratory is alive with the bubbling of beakers and the hiss of volatile mixtures. The air is thick with the tang of sulfur and the acrid bite of chemical reagents. 
Worktables are cluttered with alchemical instruments, and the occasional scorch mark on the walls hints at past experiments.

- The laboratories relocated to lower quarters renovated for the introduction of the new Arcane Studies branch. 
- The laboratories are easily accessible from The Stockpile.

- Maris is investigating a patient with [Sewer Plague](conditions.md#sewer-plague), [Sight Rot](conditions.md#sight-rot) or later also [Cackle Fever](conditions.md#cackle-fever). And is harvesting organs from the beheaded corpse from the elevator accident.
- The Patient has severe tremors, shaking hands, which are withdrawal symptoms of Black Lotus. **MEDICINE** to identify.
- **Maris** believes this is not something originating from The Stockpile or The Pit, but is not sure.  
- If wanted she uses a sending stone to call **Zara**, zara places the sending stone next to the other (giving players the opportunity to steal them).
- **Zara** after quick analysis determines that it shares the "same magical weave with the necromancy clearly emanating from the crypt I detected when I was asked to monitor magical intrusion of the Academy's foundation after the recent tremors." (there is no intrusion, but the necromancy is apparent). 
- **Zara** after brief introduction then urges **Maris** to rush to a Merchant Council gathering about the appointment of **Grand Factor Silan Thornvale** as new administer of trade and chapel caretaker. And they rush out, Maris dismisses patient through secret door she just clicks open. (they leave the sending stones on the table) 

**Potential Reward**: [Sending Stones](dm/items.md#sending-stones)

## The Upper City

[TODO] Merchants, Council meeting, 1 or two NPC roles prepared
[TODO] **Grand Factor Silan Thornvale** -> Balding, White Robe.

- Clean polished marble plates and ornate wood guard rails.


## The Undercity

### The Stockpile
[Street Kid Tobben](dm/npcs.md#street-kid-tobben) is to be found across The Bridge, he's not around the warehouses.

- **Location**: The Stockpile hums with quiet activity, a labyrinth of vaulted chambers and shadowy alcoves carved from the city's foundation. Crates, barrels, and tightly wrapped bundles fill the spaces, forming uneven walls of trade goods and supplies. 
Flickering lanterns provide scant light, casting long, shifting shadows over bustling figures, traders, and opportunists alike. 
The air is thick with the tang of oil, mildew, and secrecy, a reminder that here, the line between legitimate commerce and shady dealings is perilously thin.

- There's paths leading out from the warehouse floors, to The Bridge (the span looking down into the depths of The Pit).
- People moving around gears and tools. 

- Two guards (people dressed as guards?) moving a crate out of a warehouse room towards The Bridge.

- Some boxes in the warehouse contain **Slot Machines.**
  Polished brass casing, snugly fit within the crate lined with straw to cushion it.
  A Scent of oiled metal and freshly worked wood wafts from the crate.
  Through the clean glass panel you can see rows of vibrant symbols - visualized runes, gems, and coins.
  It features a hand crank on the side, a wooden lever with an ivory ball at the end.
  There is a slit in the brass next to the crank, a little finger's width.
  **When the crank is pulled**, the symbols spin wildly before clattering into place with the satisfying click of brass levers locking into position. 
    - A soft chime accompanies a win, while the faint scent of oil and ozone lingers in the air.

- Some boxes contain Black Lotus. (touching the flower poisons your skin, giving you a rash.)
  procedure: Dry flower, soak in tar and rinse with strong vegetable soap. Dry crispy in oven. crush to powder. mix with animal fat as cream to smear behind the lips or sniff dry.

- Someone involved with The Stockpile Business summoned animated objects to hide some evidence.
  [Animated Broom (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#animated-broom)
  [Animated Kettle (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#animated-kettle)
  [Animated Battleaxe (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#animated-battleaxe)
  [Rug of Smothering (2)](dm/monsters.md#rug-of-smothering)

  [Bandit Routewolf (1/2)](dm/monsters.md#bandit-routewolf)
  [Bandit (1/8)](dm/monsters.md#bandit)


### The Pit
- **Location**: Far below the Stockpile, the air grows heavy and oppressive, and the cavernous expanse of the Pit stretches into the dark. Makeshift homes and shanties cling precariously to the walls, their occupants eking out a living amidst the underworld's strange and chaotic energy. 
- The chatter of diverse voices — *gruff, lilting, and guttural* — echoes through the gloom, mingling with the distant sounds of flowing water and shifting stone. Dim phosphorescent fungi provide a ghostly light, illuminating the signs of a thriving yet precarious community, teetering between survival and descent into the mysteries of the Underdark below.

[Aberration](dm/monster_info.md#aberration)
[Cavern Choker (1/2)](dm/monsters.md#cavern-choker)

## The Bakery
- **Brennar Stonewright**: Dwarf -> Jovial with a bushy brown beard, his eyes crinkle with deep laugh lines, a testament to his hearty humor.

- **Location**: The warm, yeasty scent of fresh bread envelops you as you step into the cozy bakery. A stout dwarf with flour-dusted hands works deftly at kneading dough, his braided beard swinging with the rhythm. Rows of golden loaves and sweet pastries line the shelves, their crusts glistening in the soft glow of the hearth.


## The Tavern
- **Brunhild Ironwhisper**: Dwarf -> Flush cheeks with freckles and a wide nose, dark blue eyes. Long light brown hair resting on her shoulders in two thick braids.

- **Location**: The hearty hum of conversation and clinking tankards fills the rustic tavern, its wooden beams adorned with old mining tools and hunting trophies. Behind the counter, a robust dwarven woman NPC with a quick smile pours frothy ales into sturdy mugs. The air is rich with the aroma of roast and spiced cider, inviting weary travelers to rest their feet.

  - Fuller than usual, since elevator traffic has halted and people are held up.

## The Ruins
### The Castle Ruins
- **Skeleton of Lyanna Harvestsong** in the north tower.

- **Location**: The air is thick and damp as you approach the remnants of the estate, now a hollow shell of its former self. 
  The jagged outline of crumbled stone walls juts from the surface of murky, knee-deep sludgy water.
  Mud and decay cling to every surface, and the faint outlines of once-proud arches and windows are obscured by grime. 
  A stagnant stench fills the air, and the occasional ripple suggests unseen movement below the surface. 
  Whatever history this place once held now lies buried, swallowed by the mire.

  In the water [Poolish Ooze Discard (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#poolish-ooze-discard).

  Lyanna's body flops into a [Boneless (1/2)](dm/monsters.md#boneless) and a [Skeleton Warrior (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#skeleton-warrior) with just it's finger bones sharpened.
