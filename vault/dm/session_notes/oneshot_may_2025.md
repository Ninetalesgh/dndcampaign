# NPCS

**Umberlee** – The Bitch Queen
    Portfolio: Oceans, storms, shipwrecks
    Alignment: Chaotic Evil
    Worshipped by: Sailors (to appease her), pirates, coastal dwellers
    Symbol: Wave curling left and right
    Vibe: A violent, tempestuous goddess who demands tribute or brings death at sea. Most feared sea deity.

**Captain Jareth Carr** - Mad-Eye "Glass"
  - Known as Glass because he's painfully honest and the worst liar anyone will have ever met.
  - He has a cracked glass eye.

**Evelyn Marrowind** - The captured imperial mariner
  - Bloody from beatings.

**"Stitch" Branlow** - Dwarven Tavernkeeper of **The Dancing Sea Cow**
  - A bit of a stickler, called "Stitch" because he is so sharp with his words that victims of his burns need stitches. 

# Introduction

- **Hermit** and **Tree** chill in their little rocky hill forest next to a waterfall, overseeing the cove.
Campfire there, warming them in the fresh ocean breeze, staring at a visibly beat Galleon anchored in the deeper waters off shore.
  - Bumping and faint chanting from inside the waterfall??
  
- **Gul'Dan** and **Shipwright** in a small, scattered port town called **Pearl's Rest** in **Purple Cove**. there's a little uncared-for looking shrine to **Umberlee**, colloquially referred to as The Bitch Queen. A clumsy shanty tune coming out of a tavern with a little scribbled on wood plank hanging off its side **The Dancing Sea Cow**.
  - **"Stitch" Branlow**, the tavernkeeper, to **Gul'Dan**: "I don't care if you don't have anything. Go find work and come back when you can afford my fine supplies.", tavern kind of giggles.

- **Juni** and **Smith** anchored and are being shipped out to the town, the waters are too shallow for the Galleon you came on, so a little caravel it is. You just suffered a close victory against an imperial destroyer. Managed to capture one of their sailors.
  - There to run errands, Captain **Mad-Eye "Glass" Carr** asks **Smith** to find someone to help fix up their cargo bay leaks, since it needs more people, and your previous specialist.
  - **Glass** asks of **Juni** to find an arcanist to read the thoughts of the captured marine, "we need to figure out how they got to know about our smuggling route."
