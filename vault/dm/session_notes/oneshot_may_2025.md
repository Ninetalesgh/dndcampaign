**Evelyn Marrowind** - The captured imperial mariner
  - Bloody from beatings.

# Introduction

- **Hermit** and **Tree** chill in their little rocky hill forest next to a little waterfall.
Campfire there, warming them in the fresh ocean breeze, staring at a visibly beat Galleon anchored in the deeper waters off shore.

- **Gul'Dan** and **Shipwright** in a small, scattered port town called **Pearlrest**. there's a little uncared-for looking shrine to **Umberlee**, colloquially referred to as The Bitch Queen. A clumsy shanty tune coming out of a tavern with a little scribbled on wood plank hanging off its side **The Dancing Cow**.

- **Juni** and **Smith** anchored and are being shipped out to the town, the waters are too shallow for the Galleon you came on, so a little caravel it is. You just suffered a close victory against an imperial destroyer. Managed to capture one of their sailors.
  - There to run errands, Captain **Mad-Eye "Glass" Carr** asks **Smith** to find someone to help fix up their cargo bay leaks, since it needs more people, and your previous specialist.
  - **Glass** asks of **Juni** to find an arcanist to read the thoughts of the captured marine, "we need to figure out how they got to know about our smuggling route."
