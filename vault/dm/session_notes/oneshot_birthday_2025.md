# Introduction

**Oghrann** in the past was one of many underdark dwarven realms in the kingdoms of old. 
Located underground below the Farsea Marshes, bordering the Stormhorns in the east and the Sunset mountains in the west.
Now the city is mostly populated by drow, but as a formerly prosperous dwarven city it has good access to the surface, which now makes for 

The sigil of **Oghrann** was a hunting horn.

[TODO] **Oghrann** in the underdark below the Stormhorns in the east.

**Ooltul** -> also known as City of Tyrants -> Beholder city in the north with a large slave population, mostly comprised of Orcs and Goblins, but also the occasional Ogre or Asabi (Reptilian Humanoid sanddwellers)

[TODO] Introduce rough NPCs that talk about Ooltul 
Gul'dan is in conversation with [TODO] orc npc about many exiled orcs ending up in **Ooltul** as slave workers, latest reports tell us that they have advanced arcane experiments and while there hasn't been any sighting yet, whatever monstrosities they made, the new refined green stones are involved. We might be able to buy some orcs' freedom if we get our hands on something the tyrants of Ooltul want.
