## The Mylen Farmstead
### The Plateau

  - The river called "Limvael" (Elvish for 'Clear/Water Pool'), 
    a creek, called **"Arm of Limvael"**. 
  The dwarves referred to the underground streams flowing out underneath the riverpool as **"Drinathar"** - 'Waters of Silver'.

  - Slight haze in the air, cloudy. Lush gently rolling hills, Farmsteads scattered across The Plateau, in the back you see arboreal mountain ranges rise on the horizon in the west and south.
      In the east you have a steep embankment dropping down into the valley, granting a stunning view across the King's Forest in the Cormyr lowlands. (The entire Plateau is roughly 2x12km)
  - Through the center runs, north to south, a creek originating from the River nurturing New Arvandal, the Arm of Limvael.
  - The path next to the creek you run along is made of **cobblestone**.

- **Location**: 
  - Nestled against the inner edge of the plateau, the farmstead sits in ruin, its fences splintered and crops trampled.
  - In the back (200m) on the pasture along the edge of the forest a group of goblins are dragging a couple of sheep into the forest.
  - You see a woman slouched on the ground against a splintered wooden fence, a spear sticking out from her guts.
  - Chickens scatter nervously around the farm, clucking and hopping, you see two goblins, each holding a chicken by its feet.

ROLL INITIATIVE

  - Garrin: "Lilly!". He runs to her, tears start gathering in his eyes "We have to find Merrick and their daughter!"
  - Tess: "
  - 

  AFTER THE BATTLE: 
  - The clucking is the only sound aside from the eerie creak of the farmhouse door swinging ajar in the alpine breeze.
  - Smoke rises from the smoldering remains of the barn, and the acrid scent of burnt hay mingles with the iron tang of spilled blood.

### The Pasture
- **Location**: Rolling green hills stretch toward the distant tree line, the soft grass stained by frantic footprints heading toward the woods. The air is sharp and brisk, carrying the faint cries of goblins fleeing into the shadows. A lone goat bleats mournfully beside an overturned trough, its plaintive call punctuating the tense pursuit. [TODO]

This is where the second fight will take place? with the wounded warg.
Other goblins are fleeing in the background.
[TODO] intro.

### The Trail
- **Location**: The narrow trail winds upward, flanked by jagged rock faces on one side and sheer drops on the other. Broken branches and faint smears of blood mark the goblins' passage, leading into the shadowy embrace of the pine forest above. The wind whistles through the crags, carrying a faint, ominous echo that seems to urge haste.

The trail chasing the goblins that fled.

### The Entrance Hall
- **Location**: The vaulted ceiling soars above with intricate frescoes of celestial bodies and arcane symbols, illuminated by streams of light pouring through stained glass windows.

[TODO] intro.
### The Library
- **Location**: A labyrinth of towering bookshelves stretches into the dimly lit distance, the scent of aged leather and ink hanging heavily in the air. Soft candlelight flickers, casting dancing shadows on the ornate carvings of the wooden shelves. The only sound is the rustle of pages turning and the occasional murmur of scholars lost in study.

The library rooms are spread across the entire Academy, but the main halls are found in the lower floors easily reachable from the entrance hall and elevators. The Arcane Studies rooms are seated close to the big library.
[TODO] intro.
### The Laboratories
- **Maris Tindle**: Halfling -> Serious expression, soft skin, shoulder long flowing black hair, black eyes, tools strapped on her waist and her chest wrapped in a tight vest.
 
- **Location**: Dimly lit by flickering sconces, the stone-walled laboratory is alive with the bubbling of beakers and the hiss of volatile mixtures. The air is thick with the tang of sulfur and the acrid bite of chemical reagents. Worktables are cluttered with alchemical instruments, and the occasional scorch mark on the walls hints at past experiments gone awry.

The laboratories relocated to lower quarters renovated for the introduction of the new Arcane Studies branch. The laboratories are easily accessible from The Stockpile.

- **Location**: The warm, yeasty scent of fresh bread envelops you as you step into the cozy bakery. A stout dwarf with flour-dusted hands works deftly at kneading dough, his braided beard swinging with the rhythm. Rows of golden loaves and sweet pastries line the shelves, their crusts glistening in the soft glow of the hearth.
[TODO] intro. NPC

## The Tavern
- **Brunhild Ironwhisper**: Dwarf -> Flush cheeks with freckles and a wide nose, dark blue eyes. Long light brown hair resting on her shoulders in two thick braids.

- **Location**: The hearty hum of conversation and clinking tankards fills the rustic tavern, its wooden beams adorned with old mining tools and hunting trophies. Behind the counter, a robust dwarven woman with a quick wit and a quicker smile pours frothy ales into sturdy mugs. The air is rich with the aroma of roasting meats and spiced cider, inviting weary travelers to rest their feet.
