# Scenes

## The Mylen Farmstead
**Farmer Merrick Mylen.** -> Human. [TODO] dies? 

### The Main Farmhouse

- **Location**: Nestled against the inner edge of the plateau, the farmstead sits in ruin, its fences splintered and crops trampled. Smoke rises from the smoldering remains of the barn, and the acrid scent of burnt hay mingles with the iron tang of spilled blood. Chickens scatter nervously, their clucking the only sound aside from the eerie creak of the farmhouse door swinging ajar in the cold alpine breeze. [TODO]


In the back along the pasture 

This is where the first fight will take place, with surprised goblins.
goblins will start fleeing, 3 will enter combat with the players here.
[TODO] intro.

### The Pasture
- **Location**: Rolling green hills stretch toward the distant tree line, the soft grass stained by frantic footprints heading toward the woods. The air is sharp and brisk, carrying the faint cries of goblins fleeing into the shadows. A lone goat bleats mournfully beside an overturned trough, its plaintive call punctuating the tense pursuit. [TODO]

This is where the second fight will take place? with the wounded warg.
Other goblins are fleeing in the background.
[TODO] intro.

### The Trail
- **Location**: The narrow trail winds upward, flanked by jagged rock faces on one side and sheer drops on the other. Broken branches and faint smears of blood mark the goblins' passage, leading into the shadowy embrace of the pine forest above. The wind whistles through the crags, carrying a faint, ominous echo that seems to urge haste.

The trail chasing the goblins that fled.

### The Entrance Hall
- **Location**: The vaulted ceiling soars above with intricate frescoes of celestial bodies and arcane symbols, illuminated by streams of light pouring through stained glass windows. Polished marble floors echo with footsteps, and the air is scented faintly with parchment and candle wax. Students and scholars bustle about, their robes swirling as they move between lecture halls and study chambers. [TODO]


The entrance hall 
[TODO] intro.
### The Library
- **Location**: A labyrinth of towering bookshelves stretches into the dimly lit distance, the scent of aged leather and ink hanging heavily in the air. Soft candlelight flickers, casting dancing shadows on the ornate carvings of the wooden shelves. The only sound is the rustle of pages turning and the occasional murmur of scholars lost in study.

The library rooms are spread across the entire Academy, but the main halls are found in the lower floors easily reachable from the entrance hall and elevators. The Arcane Studies rooms are seated close to the big library.
[TODO] intro.
### The Laboratories
- **Maris Tindle**: Halfling -> Serious expression, soft skin, shoulder long flowing black hair, black eyes, tools strapped on her waist and her chest wrapped in a tight vest.
 
- **Location**: Dimly lit by flickering sconces, the stone-walled laboratory is alive with the bubbling of beakers and the hiss of volatile mixtures. The air is thick with the tang of sulfur and the acrid bite of chemical reagents. Worktables are cluttered with alchemical instruments, and the occasional scorch mark on the walls hints at past experiments gone awry.

The laboratories relocated to lower quarters renovated for the introduction of the new Arcane Studies branch. The laboratories are easily accessible from The Stockpile.
[TODO] intro.
- The Academy Alchemy department. 
[TODO] Investigate the root + Maris telling the players about Black Lotus troubles. 

## The Bakery
- **Brennar Stonewright**: Dwarf -> Jovial with a bushy brown beard, his eyes crinkle with deep laugh lines, a testament to his hearty humor.

- **Location**: The warm, yeasty scent of fresh bread envelops you as you step into the cozy bakery. A stout dwarf with flour-dusted hands works deftly at kneading dough, his braided beard swinging with the rhythm. Rows of golden loaves and sweet pastries line the shelves, their crusts glistening in the soft glow of the hearth.
[TODO] intro. NPC

## The Tavern
- **Brunhild Ironwhisper**: Dwarf -> Flush cheeks with freckles and a wide nose, dark blue eyes. Long light brown hair resting on her shoulders in two thick braids.

- **Location**: The hearty hum of conversation and clinking tankards fills the rustic tavern, its wooden beams adorned with old mining tools and hunting trophies. Behind the counter, a robust dwarven woman with a quick wit and a quicker smile pours frothy ales into sturdy mugs. The air is rich with the aroma of roasting meats and spiced cider, inviting weary travelers to rest their feet.
