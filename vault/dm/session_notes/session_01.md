[Farmer Garrin Harvestsong](dm/npcs.md#farmer-garrin-harvestsong)

**Captain Teal Lareth.** -> Clean shaven bald head. tall, broad shoulders. 

- Dain sees you hesitate: "There will be 10 gold pieces for everyone of you who joins. Teal, just in case this is more than they can handle, get 10 out of the pit on standby for this." 

- Teal nods harshly "Tess, with them".
- Teal walks off towards the academy elevators.
- Garrin, Tessa, and players run to out Guard Tower at The Plateau Gate
- A lookout on the tower matches eyes with Tess: "West side of the shelf, the Mylen farmstead, there's smoke!"
- Tess offers armaments to players (armor, shields, javelins) consider don speed? 

- ~5km distance ATHLETICS check to keep a good pace if you wanted to put on armor?



# Scenes
## The Mylen Farmstead
### The Plateau

  - The river called "Limvael" (Elvish for 'Clear/Water Pool'), 
    a creek, called **"Arm of Limvael"**. 
  The dwarves referred to the underground streams flowing out underneath the riverpool as **"Drinathar"** - 'Waters of Silver'.

  - Slight haze in the air, cloudy. Lush gently rolling hills, Farmsteads scattered across The Plateau, in the back you see arboreal mountain ranges rise on the horizon in the west and south.
      In the east you have a steep embankment dropping down into the valley, granting a stunning view across the King's Forest in the Cormyr lowlands. (The entire Plateau is roughly 2x12km)
  - Through the center runs, north to south, a creek originating from the River nurturing New Arvandal, the Arm of Limvael.
  - The path next to the creek you run along is made of **cobblestone**. 

### The Farmhouse and Barn
**Farmer Merrick Mylen.** -> Human. short cut fuzzy dark hair. 
**Farmer Lilly Mylen.** -> Human. shoulder long dark hair. light brown skin.
**Farmer's Daugther Ginny Mylen.** -> Tiefling. Pale purple skin, white eyes, small horn stumps 

**Goat Becky** -> Ginny's favorite goat that got stolen.
**Goblin Names** -> Grot, Blik, Skrub, Zorp, Krizz, Frub, Snog.

[Farmhouse](https://watabou.github.io/dwellings/?seed=924670409&tags=basement,organic,low&plan=EF7FBBFD10E00778B3CD1EEF7FFBFF1&w=11&h=11)

- **Location**: 
  - Nestled against the inner edge of the plateau, the farmstead sits in ruin, its fences splintered and crops trampled.
  - In the back (200m) on the pasture along the edge of the forest a group of goblins are dragging a couple of sheep into the forest.
  - You see a woman slouched on the ground against a splintered wooden fence, a spear sticking out from her guts.

  - Garrin: "Lilly!". He runs to her, tears start gathering in his eyes "We have to find Merrick and their daughter!" he runs towards the farm.
  - Chickens scatter nervously around the farm, clucking and hopping, you see **3 Goblins**, each holding an upside down chicken.
ROLL INITIATIVE
  - Tess readies to confront the three: "Someone follow him inside!" 
  [Goblin (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#goblin)
  [Worg (1/2)](dm/monsters.md#worg) with Speed 2!

  - When players approach the farm house, Merrick stumbles out chased by **2 Goblins**. 
    **"Garrin, Chauntea's grace! Where are Lilly and Ginny?"**

  - When Goblins are about to retreat, they set fire to hay on the south edge of the barn.

  AFTER THE BATTLE: 
  - The air is sharp and brisk, carrying the faint cries of goblins and goats echoing out of the woods.
  - A lone goat bleats mournfully beside an overturned trough, that and the clucking are the only sound aside from the eerie creak of the farmhouse door swinging ajar in the alpine breeze.

  IF FIRE:
  - Smoke rises from the smoldering remains of the barn, and the acrid scent of burnt hay mingles with the iron tang of spilled blood. 

  QUEST CONT: 
  - They were never this aggressive before, until now they just stole livestock.

### The Pasture
- **Location**: Green hills stretch toward the tree line, the soft grass stained by frantic footprints heading toward the woods. 

### The Trail
- **Location**: The fairly narrow trail, flanked by steep leaf covered embankments, winds upward deeper into the Stormhorns.
  Broken branches and faint smears of blood mark the goblins' passage, leading into the embrace of the pine forest above. 

- The wind whistles through the crags, carrying their faint echo.
- If they chase, they catch up to one Goblin and one wounded Worg that were left behind. 
- If they chase further, after 2 hours they catch up and spot a raiding party of ~15 Goblins, with their leader **Grishka** at the helm.

# Secrets

- The Goblins are a scouting branch with leader **Fizzra**, so far they have only stolen livestock. 
  The attack was not an order by their leader, but a Renegade Group, **The Bonebiters**, with their leader **Grishka**, who want to clear The Plateau to impress The Army.

- Lyanna Harvestsong has been missing for 5 years now.

- The Corrupted Root is a young branch, so it must've grown really recently, and it reeks of Necromancy.

- Kobolds steal food from the Tavern Pantry.

- Kobolds have a Kurtulmak shrine underneath Waukeen's Chapel adjacent to the smuggling tunnels.
[Kobold (1/8)](dm/monsters.md#kobold)
[Kobold Rockbruiser (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#kobold-rockbruiser)
[Kobold Inventor (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#kobold-inventor)

- Tazlyn Stonewright is Brennar's Ancestor, he still has books of hers. 

- The Guards want to pressure the Thieves' Guild out of The Stockpile. 

- The Thieves' Guild is extremely on edge but also desperate to recruit more people.

# UNSORTED

Tess confronts Mufi about his performance getting into her way. And the kid must've stolen her keys.


Goblins stab the hooves of draft horse so they have to be put down.
Cows drink polluted water, go into a frenzy and have to be put down?


- Wild animals in the mountains aggressive and push down towards the plateau. (the army does something that pushes them away?)
- Some of the people that live in the mountains haven't been seen in a while? (something is going on in the mountains?)


- **Berric Morgrim.** Missing tooth, patchy beard. (jittering hand)
thief threatens XYZ and then rushes to sewer entrance
> Kazimir knows Berric's jittering hand symptoms as likely caused by Black Lotus, which.. well, refining it makes money.


- capture one alive? 

- Tess beats one goblin to death violently.
- if noone speaks Goblin, Tess will snark "The wood worker **Veshka** probably does".
