# Scenes
## The Mylen Farmstead
### The Plateau

  - The river called "Limvael" (Elvish for 'Clear/Water Pool'), 
    a creek, called **"Arm of Limvael"**. 
  The dwarves referred to the underground streams flowing out underneath the riverpool as **"Drinathar"** - 'Waters of Silver'.

  - Slight haze in the air, cloudy. Lush gently rolling hills, Farmsteads scattered across The Plateau, in the back you see arboreal mountain ranges rise on the horizon in the west and south.
      In the east you have a steep embankment dropping down into the valley, granting a stunning view across the King's Forest in the Cormyr lowlands. (The entire Plateau is roughly 2x12km)
  - Through the center runs, north to south, a creek originating from the River nurturing New Arvandal, the Arm of Limvael.
  - The path next to the creek you run along is made of **cobblestone**. 

### The Farmhouse and Barn
**Farmer Merrick Mylen.** -> Human. short cut fuzzy dark hair. 
**Farmer Lilly Mylen.** -> Human. shoulder long dark hair. light brown skin.
**Farmer's Daugther Ginny Mylen.** -> Tiefling. Pale purple skin, white eyes, small horn stumps 

**Goat Becky** -> Ginny's favorite goat that got stolen.
**Goblin Names** -> Grot, Blik, Skrub, Zorp, Krizz, Frub, Snog.

[Farmhouse](https://watabou.github.io/dwellings/?seed=924670409&tags=basement,organic,low&plan=EF7FBBFD10E00778B3CD1EEF7FFBFF1&w=11&h=11)

- **Location**: 
  - Nestled against the inner edge of the plateau, the farmstead sits in ruin, its fences splintered and crops trampled.
  - In the back (200m) on the pasture along the edge of the forest a group of goblins are dragging a couple of sheep into the forest.
  - You see a woman slouched on the ground against a splintered wooden fence, a spear sticking out from her guts.

  - Garrin: "Lilly!". He runs to her, tears start gathering in his eyes "We have to find Merrick and their daughter!" he runs towards the farm.
  - Chickens scatter nervously around the farm, clucking and hopping, you see **3 Goblins**, each holding an upside down chicken.
ROLL INITIATIVE
  - Tess readies to confront the three: "Someone follow him inside!" 
  [Goblin (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#goblin)
  [Worg (1/2)](dm/monsters.md#worg) with Speed 2!

  - When players approach the farm house, Merrick stumbles out chased by **2 Goblins**. 
    **"Garrin, Chauntea's grace! Where are Lilly and Ginny?"**

  - When Goblins are about to retreat, they set fire to hay on the south edge of the barn.

  AFTER THE BATTLE: 
  - The air is sharp and brisk, carrying the faint cries of goblins and goats echoing out of the woods.
  - A lone goat bleats mournfully beside an overturned trough, that and the clucking are the only sound aside from the eerie creak of the farmhouse door swinging ajar in the alpine breeze.

  IF FIRE:
  - Smoke rises from the smoldering remains of the barn, and the acrid scent of burnt hay mingles with the iron tang of spilled blood. 

  QUEST CONT: 
  - They were never this aggressive before, until now they just stole livestock.

### The Pasture
- **Location**: Green hills stretch toward the tree line, the soft grass stained by frantic footprints heading toward the woods. 

### The Trail
- **Location**: The fairly narrow trail, flanked by steep leaf covered embankments, winds upward deeper into the Stormhorns.
  Broken branches and faint smears of blood mark the goblins' passage, leading into the embrace of the pine forest above. 

- The wind whistles through the crags, carrying their faint echo.
- If they chase, they catch up to one Goblin and one wounded Worg that were left behind. 
- If they chase further, after 2 hours they catch up and spot a raiding party of ~15 Goblins, with their leader **Grishka** at the helm.

## The Academy
upper north east - cartography & exploration
Along the elevator: 
  upper south west - mechanics
  lower south west - stone works
median market side - diplomacy & commerce
upper cellars - arcane studies
lower cellars - alchemy medicine (laboratories)
### The Entrance Hall
- **Location**: The vaulted ceiling soars above with intricate frescoes of celestial bodies and arcane symbols, illuminated by streams of light pouring through stained glass windows. Freshly polished marble floors echo with footsteps, and the air is scented faintly with parchment and candle wax.
  - Nearing the end of the off-season, students and scholars begin to bustle about at higher numbers again, their robes swirling as they move between lecture halls and study chambers. 

  - The canteen and lavatories on the entrance level, stairways and elevators lead to the lecture, laboraty, and library rooms. 

### The Library
- **Location**: A labyrinth of dimly lit towering bookshelves, the scent of aged leather and ink hanging heavily in the air. 
  Soft candlelight flickers, casting dancing shadows on the ornate carvings of the wooden shelves. 
  The only sound is the rustle of pages turning and the occasional murmur of scholars lost in study.

The library rooms are spread across the entire Academy, but the main halls are found in the lower floors easily reachable from the entrance hall and elevators. The Arcane Studies rooms are seated close to the big library.

### The Laboratories
- **Maris Tindle**: Halfling -> Serious expression, soft skin, shoulder long flowing black hair, black eyes, tools strapped on her waist and her chest wrapped in a tight vest.
 
- **Location**: Dimly lit by flickering sconces, the stone-walled laboratory is alive with the bubbling of beakers and the hiss of volatile mixtures. The air is thick with the tang of sulfur and the acrid bite of chemical reagents. 
Worktables are cluttered with alchemical instruments, and the occasional scorch mark on the walls hints at past experiments.

- The laboratories relocated to lower quarters renovated for the introduction of the new Arcane Studies branch. 
- The laboratories are easily accessible from The Stockpile.

- Maris Tindle preparing and cleaning her personal equipment.

[TODO] Investigate the root + Maris telling the players about Black Lotus troubles. 

## The Undercity

### The Stockpile
[Street Kid Tobben](dm/npcs.md#street-kid-tobben) is to be found across The Bridge, he's not around the warehouses.

- **Location**: The Stockpile hums with quiet activity, a labyrinth of vaulted chambers and shadowy alcoves carved from the city's foundation. Crates, barrels, and tightly wrapped bundles fill the spaces, forming uneven walls of trade goods and supplies. 
Flickering lanterns provide scant light, casting long, shifting shadows over bustling figures, traders, and opportunists alike. 
The air is thick with the tang of oil, mildew, and secrecy, a reminder that here, the line between legitimate commerce and shady dealings is perilously thin.

- There's paths leading out from the warehouse floors, to The Bridge (the span looking down into the depths of The Pit).
- People moving around gears and tools. 

- Two guards (people dressed as guards?) moving a crate out of a warehouse room towards The Bridge.

- Some boxes in the warehouse contain **Slot Machines.**
  Polished brass casing, snugly fit within the crate lined with straw to cushion it.
  A Scent of oiled metal and freshly worked wood wafts from the crate.
  Through the clean glass panel you can see rows of vibrant symbols - visualized runes, gems, and coins.
  It features a hand crank on the side, a wooden lever with an ivory ball at the end.
  There is a slit in the brass next to the crank, a little finger's width.
  **When the crank is pulled**, the symbols spin wildly before clattering into place with the satisfying click of brass levers locking into position. 
    - A soft chime accompanies a win, while the faint scent of oil and ozone lingers in the air.

- Some boxes contain Black Lotus. ()

- Someone involved with The Stockpile Business summoned animated objects to hide some evidence.

### The Pit
- **Location**: Far below the Stockpile, the air grows heavy and oppressive, and the cavernous expanse of the Pit stretches into the dark. Makeshift homes and shanties cling precariously to the walls, their occupants eking out a living amidst the underworld's strange and chaotic energy. 
The chatter of diverse voices — *gruff, lilting, and guttural* — echoes through the gloom, mingling with the distant sounds of flowing water and shifting stone. Dim phosphorescent fungi provide a ghostly light, illuminating the signs of a thriving yet precarious community, teetering between survival and descent into the mysteries of the Underdark below.

## The Bakery
- **Brennar Stonewright**: Dwarf -> Jovial with a bushy brown beard, his eyes crinkle with deep laugh lines, a testament to his hearty humor.

- **Location**: The warm, yeasty scent of fresh bread envelops you as you step into the cozy bakery. A stout dwarf with flour-dusted hands works deftly at kneading dough, his braided beard swinging with the rhythm. Rows of golden loaves and sweet pastries line the shelves, their crusts glistening in the soft glow of the hearth.


## The Tavern
- **Brunhild Ironwhisper**: Dwarf -> Flush cheeks with freckles and a wide nose, dark blue eyes. Long light brown hair resting on her shoulders in two thick braids.

- **Location**: The hearty hum of conversation and clinking tankards fills the rustic tavern, its wooden beams adorned with old mining tools and hunting trophies. Behind the counter, a robust dwarven woman NPC with a quick smile pours frothy ales into sturdy mugs. The air is rich with the aroma of roast and spiced cider, inviting weary travelers to rest their feet.

  - Fuller than usual, since elevator traffic has halted and people are held up.

## The Ruins
### The Castle Ruins
- **Skeleton of Lyanna Harvestsong** in the north tower.

- **Location**: The air is thick and damp as you approach the remnants of the estate, now a hollow shell of its former self. 
  The jagged outline of crumbled stone walls juts from the surface of murky, knee-deep sludgy water.
  Mud and decay cling to every surface, and the faint outlines of once-proud arches and windows are obscured by grime. 
  A stagnant stench fills the air, and the occasional ripple suggests unseen movement below the surface. 
  Whatever history this place once held now lies buried, swallowed by the mire.

In the water [Poolish Ooze Discard (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#poolish-ooze-discard).

### The Crypt Entrance
- **Location**: The crypt’s entrance looms before you, a solemn archway of carved stone now fractured and weathered by time.
  Moss and vines cling to the walls and stepping into the arch and five steps down, you find a small dark murky pond at the surrounding water level.

  - A gentle downwards current, pressing through the wood door.

# Secrets

- The Goblins are a scouting branch with leader **Fizzra**, so far they have only stolen livestock. 
  The attack was not an order by their leader, but a Renegade Group, **The Bonebiters**, with their leader **Grishka**, who want to clear The Plateau to impress The Army.

- Lyanna Harvestsong has been missing for 5 years now.

- The Corrupted Root is a young branch, so it must've grown really recently, and it reeks of Necromancy.

- Kobolds steal food from the Tavern Pantry.

- Kobolds have a Kurtulmak shrine underneath Waukeen's Chapel adjacent to the smuggling tunnels.

# UNSORTED

Tess confronts Mufi about his performance getting into her way. And the kid must've stolen her keys.


Goblins stab the hooves of draft horse so they have to be put down.
Cows drink polluted water, go into a frenzy and have to be put down?


- Wild animals in the mountains aggressive and push down towards the plateau. (the army does something that pushes them away?)
- Some of the people that live in the mountains haven't been seen in a while? (something is going on in the mountains?)


- **Berric Morgrim.** Missing tooth, patchy beard. (jittering hand)
thief threatens XYZ and then rushes to sewer entrance
> Kazimir knows Berric's jittering hand symptoms as likely caused by Black Lotus, which.. well, refining it makes money.


- capture one alive? 

- Tess beats one goblin to death violently.
- if noone speaks Goblin, Tess will snark "The wood worker **Veshka** probably does".
