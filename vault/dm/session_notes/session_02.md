# Introduction

## The Trail
[Fizzra](dm/npcs.md#fizzra)
**Sik**. Goblin. -> Egg shaped head with egg colored skin, with two long pointy flappy ears and a fuzzy blue patch of hair on the tip of her head.

- They chase after the goblins, they catch up to one Goblin, **Sik**, and one wounded Worg that were seemingly left behind. 
[Goblin (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#goblin), [Worg (1/2)](dm/monsters.md#worg) with Speed 2!

- **Sik** had Goblin Orders from "**Fizzra**" on her, they were: 
  - Keep **Grishka** in check.
  - Bring **Snarl** back safely.
  - Only take Livestock.

SURVIVAL -> The whincing of the Worg might well attract predators.

- Following the footsteps of the raiding party, on the peak above the tunnel an old watchtower position from Old Arvandal, camped by a group of booyahg scouts.
[2 * Booyahg Caster (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#booyahg-caster) Spells: [Fog Cloud](spells.md#fog-cloud), [Ray of Sickness](spells.md#ray-of-sickness). 
[Goblin (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#goblin) with a [Stirge Skullpiercer (1)](dm/monsters.md#stirge-skullpiercer).

- Mid-fight three wolves catches up with the party and join combat.
[2 * Wolf (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#wolf)
[Lion (1)](dm/monsters.md#lion) (use Lion statblock as bigger wolf)

**Rewards looted from the Booyahgs**: 
  - [Imbued Quarterstaff, Venom](dm/items.md#imbued-quarterstaff-venom)
  - [Orb of Shielding, Fire](dm/items.md#orb-of-shielding-fire)
  - Another parchment of Goblin Orders from "**Fizzra**".
    - Reconnaissance only, do not engage in combat, we want to keep a diplomatic approach possible.
    - Do not let raiding parties drag anything but Livestock past you.
    - Stay hidden.
    - We're here to dig only.

- They rest through the night on the scout post and in the morning they chase further north for ~5 hours and spot an intimidating **Hobgoblin Army Camp**. (more than a dozen tents)

- They turn back to town, arrive in the evening.

## Back in New Arvandal
[Tess Marwick](dm/npcs.md#tess-marwick)
[TODO] add Veshka NPC here.

- Noone speaks Goblin, **Tess** snarks "The wood worker **Veshka** probably does", incentivizing them to meet her (she does **NOT** speak any goblin, she's an Orc).

- **Tess** records the group's encounter debrief and sends it off to [Teal Lareth](dm/npcs.md#teal-lareth) and [Dain Elster](dm/npcs.md#dain-elster).

- They learn about the political friction between:
  - The Guard & Dain
  - The Merchants & The Academy Administration

- They visit **Veshka**, who is surrounded by street kids hanging out around her workshop. 
  - They learn that **Tess** was "joking".

- They visit the Academy Library to find a way to translate the goblin orders .

## The Academy
### The Entrance Hall
- **Location**: The vaulted ceiling is decorated with intricate frescoes of celestial bodies and arcane symbols, illuminated by streams of light pouring through stained glass windows. Freshly polished marble floors echo with footsteps, and the air is scented faintly with parchment and candle wax.
  - Nearing the end of the off-season, students and scholars begin to bustle about at higher numbers again. 
### The Library
[Darrin Whitlock](dm/npcs.md#darrin-whitlock)

- They encounter Darrin who translates The Goblin Orders for them.
