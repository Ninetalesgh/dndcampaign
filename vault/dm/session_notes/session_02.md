- **Sik** had Goblin Orders from "**Fizzra**" on her, they were:

# Scenes
## The Trail

    - Do not let raiding parties drag anything but Livestock past you.
    - Stay hidden.
    - We're here to dig only.

- They rest through the night on the scout post and in the morning they chase further north for ~5 hours and spot an intimidating Hobgoblin army camp. (more than a dozen tents)

- They turn back to town, arrive in the evening.

## Back in New Arvandal
[TODO] add Veshka NPC here.
[Tess Marwick](dm/npcs.md#tess-marwick)

- if noone speaks Goblin, **Tess** will snark "The wood worker **Veshka** probably does", incentivizing them to meet her (she does **NOT** speak any goblin, she's an Orc).

- **Tess** records the group's statement and sends it off to [Teal Lareth](dm/npcs.md#teal-lareth) and [Dain Elster](dm/npcs.md#dain-elster).

- They learn about the political friction between:
  - The Guard & Dain
  - The Merchants & The Academy Administration

- They visit **Veshka**, learn that **Tess** was "joking".

- They visit the Academy Library to find a way to translate the goblin orders .

## The Academy

### The Entrance Hall
- **Location**: The vaulted ceiling is decorated with intricate frescoes of celestial bodies and arcane symbols, illuminated by streams of light pouring through stained glass windows. Freshly polished marble floors echo with footsteps, and the air is scented faintly with parchment and candle wax.

  - Nearing the end of the off-season, students and scholars begin to bustle about at higher numbers again. 



### The Library
[TODO] Darrin NPC (student)
[TODO] Bok NPC (Kazimir student colleague)



- [Zara Brightscale](dm/arvandor/characters/living_npcs.md#zara-brightscale). Dragonborn -> A slender ivory snout marks her head peaked by her elegant white horns and almost lion-like scaly mane that encompasses her face. Bright blue warm and perceptive reptilian eyes. Robes a blend of ice blue and white, shimmering with faint glacial patterns.
- [Theron Windrunner](dm/arvandor/characters/living_npcs.md#theron-windrunner). Human -> The energy of a young adventurer. His sun-kissed skin reflects days spent in the wild. A faint scar across his left brow hints at a few early scrapes, but his boyish confident grin suggests he relished every moment. He wears a rugged, well-worn jacket over a practical tunic, and his utility belt is stocked with cartographer’s tools.
- [Elara Moonshadow](dm/arvandor/characters/living_npcs.md#elara-moonshadow). Elf -> Dark brown skin, silver white hair, dark blue, gold and white woven imposing dress. 

The library rooms are spread across the entire Academy, but the main halls are found in the lower floors easily reachable from the entrance hall and elevators. The Arcane Studies rooms are seated close to the big library.
[Animated Book (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#animated-book)
[Rug of Smothering (2)](dm/monsters.md#rug-of-smothering)

If desired, **Zara** or **Theron** appear here and greet the players or helps out if they are fighting the animated things. (they might frantically look for a solution for healing if someone is hurt in books on shelves?)
- **Zara** is interested in The Crypt and source of the necromantic magic and about the mine tunnels in lower Mithdral, she urged Theron to lead an expedition already.
- **Theron** is skeptic about the goblin attack being something superficial, he believes something bigger is going on. It's
- **Elara** desires a diplomatic approach to ensure flow of commerce, wants to strike deals with the antagonist authority.

### The Laboratories
- **Maris Tindle**: Halfling -> Serious expression, soft skin, shoulder long flowing black hair, black eyes, tools strapped on her waist and her chest wrapped in a tight vest.
 
- **Location**: Dimly lit by flickering sconces, the stone-walled laboratory is alive with the bubbling of beakers and the hiss of volatile mixtures. The air is thick with the tang of sulfur and the acrid bite of chemical reagents. 
Worktables are cluttered with alchemical instruments, and the occasional scorch mark on the walls hints at past experiments.

- The laboratories relocated to lower quarters renovated for the introduction of the new Arcane Studies branch. 
- The laboratories are easily accessible from The Stockpile.

- Maris is investigating a patient with [Sewer Plague](conditions.md#sewer-plague), [Sight Rot](conditions.md#sight-rot) or later also [Cackle Fever](conditions.md#cackle-fever). And is harvesting organs from the beheaded corpse from the elevator accident.
- The Patient has severe tremors, shaking hands, which are withdrawal symptoms of Black Lotus. **MEDICINE** to identify.
- **Maris** believes this is not something originating from The Stockpile or The Pit, but is not sure.  
- If wanted she uses a sending stone to call **Zara**, zara places the sending stone next to the other (giving players the opportunity to steal them).
- **Zara** after quick analysis determines that it shares the "same magical weave with the necromancy clearly emanating from the crypt I detected when I was asked to monitor magical intrusion of the Academy's foundation after the recent tremors." (there is no intrusion, but the necromancy is apparent). 
- **Zara** after brief introduction then urges **Maris** to rush to a Merchant Council gathering about the appointment of **Grand Factor Silan Thornvale** as new administer of trade and chapel caretaker. And they rush out, Maris dismisses patient through secret door she just clicks open. (they leave the sending stones on the table) 

**Potential Reward**: [Sending Stones](dm/items.md#sending-stones)

## The Undercity

### The Stockpile
[Street Kid Tobben](dm/npcs.md#street-kid-tobben) is to be found across The Bridge, he's not around the warehouses.

- **Location**: The Stockpile hums with quiet activity, a labyrinth of vaulted chambers and shadowy alcoves carved from the city's foundation. Crates, barrels, and tightly wrapped bundles fill the spaces, forming uneven walls of trade goods and supplies. 
Flickering lanterns provide scant light, casting long, shifting shadows over bustling figures, traders, and opportunists alike. 
The air is thick with the tang of oil, mildew, and secrecy, a reminder that here, the line between legitimate commerce and shady dealings is perilously thin.

- There's paths leading out from the warehouse floors, to The Bridge (the span looking down into the depths of The Pit).
- People moving around gears and tools. 

- Two guards (people dressed as guards?) moving a crate out of a warehouse room towards The Bridge.

- Some boxes in the warehouse contain **Slot Machines.**
  Polished brass casing, snugly fit within the crate lined with straw to cushion it.
  A Scent of oiled metal and freshly worked wood wafts from the crate.
  Through the clean glass panel you can see rows of vibrant symbols - visualized runes, gems, and coins.
  It features a hand crank on the side, a wooden lever with an ivory ball at the end.
  There is a slit in the brass next to the crank, a little finger's width.
  **When the crank is pulled**, the symbols spin wildly before clattering into place with the satisfying click of brass levers locking into position. 
    - A soft chime accompanies a win, while the faint scent of oil and ozone lingers in the air.

- Some boxes contain Black Lotus. (touching the flower poisons your skin, giving you a rash.)
  procedure: Dry flower, soak in tar and rinse with strong vegetable soap. Dry crispy in oven. crush to powder. mix with animal fat as cream to smear behind the lips or sniff dry.

- Someone involved with The Stockpile Business summoned animated objects to hide some evidence.
  [Animated Broom (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#animated-broom)
  [Animated Kettle (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#animated-kettle)
  [Animated Battleaxe (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#animated-battleaxe)
  [Rug of Smothering (2)](dm/monsters.md#rug-of-smothering)

  [Bandit Routewolf (1/2)](dm/monsters.md#bandit-routewolf)
  [Bandit (1/8)](dm/monsters.md#bandit)


### The Pit
- **Location**: Far below the Stockpile, the air grows heavy and oppressive, and the cavernous expanse of the Pit stretches into the dark. Makeshift homes and shanties cling precariously to the walls, their occupants eking out a living amidst the underworld's strange and chaotic energy. 
- The chatter of diverse voices — *gruff, lilting, and guttural* — echoes through the gloom, mingling with the distant sounds of flowing water and shifting stone. Dim phosphorescent fungi provide a ghostly light, illuminating the signs of a thriving yet precarious community, teetering between survival and descent into the mysteries of the Underdark below.

[Aberration](dm/monster_info.md#aberration)
[Cavern Choker (1/2)](dm/monsters.md#cavern-choker)

## The Bakery
- **Brennar Stonewright**: Dwarf -> Jovial with a bushy brown beard, his eyes crinkle with deep laugh lines, a testament to his hearty humor.

- **Location**: The warm, yeasty scent of fresh bread envelops you as you step into the cozy bakery. A stout dwarf with flour-dusted hands works deftly at kneading dough, his braided beard swinging with the rhythm. Rows of golden loaves and sweet pastries line the shelves, their crusts glistening in the soft glow of the hearth.


## The Tavern
- **Brunhild Ironwhisper**: Dwarf -> Flush cheeks with freckles and a wide nose, dark blue eyes. Long light brown hair resting on her shoulders in two thick braids.

- **Location**: The hearty hum of conversation and clinking tankards fills the rustic tavern, its wooden beams adorned with old mining tools and hunting trophies. Behind the counter, a robust dwarven woman NPC with a quick smile pours frothy ales into sturdy mugs. The air is rich with the aroma of roast and spiced cider, inviting weary travelers to rest their feet.

  - Fuller than usual, since elevator traffic has halted and people are held up.

## The Ruins
### The Castle Ruins
- **Skeleton of Lyanna Harvestsong** in the north tower.

- **Location**: The air is thick and damp as you approach the remnants of the estate, now a hollow shell of its former self. 
  The jagged outline of crumbled stone walls juts from the surface of murky, knee-deep sludgy water.
  Mud and decay cling to every surface, and the faint outlines of once-proud arches and windows are obscured by grime. 
  A stagnant stench fills the air, and the occasional ripple suggests unseen movement below the surface. 
  Whatever history this place once held now lies buried, swallowed by the mire.

  In the water [Poolish Ooze Discard (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#poolish-ooze-discard).

  Lyanna's body flops into a [Boneless (1/2)](dm/monsters.md#boneless) and a [Skeleton Warrior (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#skeleton-warrior) with just it's finger bones sharpened.

  

### The Crypt Entrance
- **Location**: The crypt’s entrance looms before you, a solemn archway of carved stone now fractured and weathered by time.
  Moss and vines cling to the walls and stepping into the arch and five steps down, you find a small dark murky pond at the surrounding water level.

  - A gentle downwards current, pressing through the wood door.

# Secrets

- The Goblins are a scouting branch with leader **Fizzra**, so far they have only stolen livestock.

-  The dwarves referred to the underground streams flowing out underneath the river **Limvael** as **"Drinathar"** - 'Waters of Silver'.

# UNSORTED

- Wild animals in the mountains aggressive and push down towards the plateau. (the army does something that pushes them away?)
- Some of the people that live in the mountains haven't been seen in a while? (something is going on in the mountains?)


- **Berric Morgrim.** Missing tooth, patchy beard. (jittering hand)
thief threatens XYZ and then rushes to sewer entrance
> Kazimir knows Berric's jittering hand symptoms as likely caused by Black Lotus, which.. well, refining it makes money.


- capture one alive? 


person dying, 30 seconds timer, 1 scroll of revivify, patron takes soul if they die.

Alenna gets reprimanded by Dain for not having enough power for purifications the previous day. (she healed Nyari and one person that fell in the elevator shaft)

Evil priest begins to cast spell on child, Alenna steps in, alenna gets hit.

Council with Dain, Merchants, and Academy members want a report from players. (topic of putting evil priest in position of waukeen's chapel comes up as tangent?) 

Nettle Blights attack Delia on the high road.

Trepidation (feeling of fear or anxiety about something that may happen.)

Parties involved in grasping power in the city: 
- Academy and Merchants (want to keep the decisionmaking in their hands)
- Dain and the Guard (Wants to gentrify the Stockpile to stabilize their finances against the merchants' influence)
- Thieves' Guild (Wants independent trade flow from Dain, independence from the merchants)
