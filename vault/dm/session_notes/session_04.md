## The Ruins
[TODO] Ruin description.


## The Crypt 

### The Crypt Entrance
- **Location**: The crypt’s entrance looms before you, a solemn archway of carved stone now fractured and weathered by time.
  Moss and vines cling to the walls and stepping into the arch and five steps down, you find a small dark murky pond at the surrounding water level.

  - A gentle downwards current, pressing through the wood door.

### The Crypt Level 0
**See Screenshot**
  - Upon entering the water sloshes to the right, as the entire structure on the right is tilted and lowered down by a step.
  - Right at the entrance is an altar showing an **elster** and a **vine** next to each other with a metal placard that reads:
     "Bound in trust, as the vine binds the earth
     and the elster soars the sky.
     Here lies the legacy of unity, where strength
     and commerce met with unshakable trust."

#### The Crypt Level 0, Left
- **Tombs**:
  **TOP**
  - A sarcophagus accessible through the narrow path between collapsed structures 
  - Contains: [Liora's Band of Trust](dm/items.md#lioras-band-of-trust), silver (30), gold (50)
    **Read**:
      "In every handshake, a promise; in every journey, a tale.
      **Liora Vinea**
      Merchant of Fortune, Friend of All Lands
      852 DR — 933 DR
      A visionary diplomat who proved that 
      tradition is but a guide, not a chain.
      The Feathered Vine Liora brought the world closer and wove unity where none had been. May Liora's steps echo eternally among the stars."

  **LEFT**
  - The estate tower that is visible from the ruins above crashed into the crypt and pushed the sarcophagus forward. 
  - The tower is identifyable by a **gothic window frame**, must have originally been above ground floor.
  - Contains: silver (20) gold (70), 
  [Thalioel's Tear](dm/items.md#thalioels-tear), a warm red tear shaped amulet.
    **Read**:
      "**Tazlyn Stonewright**
      Master Architect of Stone and Spirit
      Her hands shaped halls and paths for Dwarves and Humans,
      Her vision carved the future in granite and stone.
      Born: 681 DR — Died: 930 DR
      A legacy built in stone, spanning cultures,
      Her walls still stand, and her name still echoes,
      From the great estates of men to the deepest halls of dwarven kind.
      Rest now in the halls you built, Tazlyn, for your work endures— eternal."

  **BOTTOM**
  - A tomb accessible behind collapsed narrow paths and two thin walls to break through.
  - Contains: [Halric Varron's Blade](dm/items.md#halric-varrons-blade)
   Silver (40) gold (30), a gold ring (worth 50) 
    **Read**:
      "In the face of darkness, he stood unyielding,
      A heart of courage, a shield for the people.
      **Captain Halric Varron**
      Born: 891 DR — Died: 935 DR
      Though the mysteries of the night elude us,
      His resolve to protect never faltered.
      May his watch now end, his spirit at peace."
#### The Crypt Level 0, Right

  **TOP**
  - The entire corridor collapsed and tilts down, the water sloshing in from the entrance flows here.
  - Rubble and dirt prevents the water from flowing faster, breaking through the rubble lets the water flow further down through a rock crevasse.
    **IF TENSION IS NEEDED**: The water from above keeps flowing in - the water level rises until this drain is unclogged. Once unclogged, there is a strong current until the water level is back to ankle deep.

  **RIGHT**
  - This corridor is elevated higher than the entrance level on the other side, Water will fill up here last. 
  - The gap to climb through quite tight, but manageable even for larger humans.
  - On the right side the floor collapsed and there is a gap leading down to **The Crypt Level 1**.


## The High Road
- [Delia Leabrace](dm/npcs.md#delia-leabrace)

- Blights attack Delia on the high road. They grew out of the ground there and corrupt the flowers and vines.

[Needle Blights (1/2)](dm/monsters.md#needle-blight)
[Leaf Blight (Minion, 1)](dm/monsters.md#leaf-blight)
[Vine Blight (1)](dm/monsters.md#vine-blight)

# Secrets

- The Goblins are a scouting branch with leader **Fizzra**, so far they have only stolen livestock. 
  The attack was not an order by their leader, but a Renegade Group, **The Bonebiters**, with their leader **Grishka**, who want to clear The Plateau to impress The Army. ??

- Lyanna Harvestsong has been missing for almost a year now.

- Kobolds steal food from the Tavern Pantry.

- Kobolds have a Kurtulmak shrine underneath Waukeen's Chapel adjacent to the smuggling tunnels.
[Kobold (1/8)](dm/monsters.md#kobold)
[Kobold Rockbruiser (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#kobold-rockbruiser)
[Kobold Inventor (1/4)](dm/monsters.md#kobold-inventor)
[Kobold Trapcaster (1/2)](dm/monsters.md#kobold-trapcaster)
[Kobold Dragonshields (1)](dm/monsters.md#kobold-dragonshield)
[Kobold Scale Sorcerers (1)](dm/monsters.md#kobold-scale-sorcerer)

- Tazlyn Stonewright is Brennar's Ancestor, he still has books of hers. 

- The Guards want to pressure the Thieves' Guild out of The Stockpile. 

- The Thieves' Guild is extremely on edge but also desperate to recruit more people.

-  The dwarves referred to the underground streams flowing out underneath the river **Limvael** as **"Drinathar"** - 'Waters of Silver'.


# UNSORTED

- Wild animals in the mountains aggressive and push down towards the plateau. (the army does something that pushes them away?)
- Some of the people that live in the mountains haven't been seen in a while? (something is going on in the mountains?)


- **Berric Morgrim.** Missing tooth, patchy beard. (jittering hand)
thief threatens XYZ and then rushes to sewer entrance
> Kazimir knows Berric's jittering hand symptoms as likely caused by Black Lotus, which.. well, refining it makes money.

[TODO] Some of the elves in the crypt are from scorpion tribe? makes for great loot spots.

[TODO] Bok NPC (Kazimir student colleague)

person dying, 30 seconds timer, 1 scroll of revivify, patron takes soul if they die.

Alenna gets reprimanded by Dain for not having enough power for purifications the previous day. (she healed Nyari and one person that fell in the elevator shaft)

Evil priest begins to cast spell on child, Alenna steps in, alenna gets hit.

Council with Dain, Merchants, and Academy members want a report from players. (topic of putting evil priest in position of waukeen's chapel comes up as tangent?) 

Trepidation (feeling of fear or anxiety about something that may happen.)

Parties involved in grasping power in the city: 
- Academy and Merchants (want to keep the decisionmaking in their hands)
- Dain and the Guard (Wants to gentrify the Stockpile to stabilize their finances against the merchants' influence)
- Thieves' Guild (Wants independent trade flow from Dain, independence from the merchants)

Dalereckoning (DR) and Cormyr Reckoning (CR = DR-25) both used in the past, New Arvandal is using primarily DR historically because of the closeness to the elves of Cormanthyr.
