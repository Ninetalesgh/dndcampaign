- **Kazimir** is going home to The Stockpile.

- The Party comes back from The Crypt and visits the baker **Brennar Stonewright** and learn that he stores **Tazlyn Stonewright**'s old books in his room.

- **Nyari** goes to see the Blacksmith **Ronan Hammerfall** and rents The furnace and anvil to work on his **Mithral Armor**. Ronan lets him know that he and his partner **Seraphine Sorelle** are always interested in rare metals.
  - Additionally, The Party can melt down jewelery to sell to them at a bad rate.

- **Ayra**, **Kal**, and **Mufi** decide to break into The Bakery and steal the blueprints of The Crypt and learn about the history of the elves, **Thalioel**, **Myth Drannor**, **The Blood Curse**, the battle against **The Frozen Depths**.

- **Kal** learns that his ancestors, just like the elves buried in Arvandal, were refugees from **The Weeping War** that led to the corruption of the **Myth** and the fall of **Myth Drannor**.

- **Ayra** learns from **Mizora** that the souls she is currently collecting are being thrown into **The Blood War** for **Zariel** against a **Yugoloth** general named **Thrazzt'ryl**, who was an active participant in the invasion of **Cormanthyr/Myth Drannor**. (Thrazzt'ryl is tied to the eradication of Kal's bloodline somehow)
