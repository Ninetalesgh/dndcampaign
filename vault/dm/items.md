*(Wondrous Item, Uncommon)*
- **Properties**:
  - This small whittling knife has a green blade and can be used in place of a set of [Woodcarver's Tools](dm/items.md#woodcarvers-tools) and as if you were proficient with it.
  - Over the course of several hours, you can use the knife to carve a Tiny statue from fine wood, which can't be larger than 30cm in any dimension. At the end of each hour you spend carving the statue, make a DC 10 DEX check, adding your PB to the roll if you were already proficient with [Woodcarver's Tools](dm/items.md#woodcarvers-tools). The statue is successfully completed if you succeed on four of these checks, or unfortunately mangled and destroyed if you fail two of them.
  The statue can do minor feats of animation, which you decide upon completing it. If it moves, it can't leave its space on its own. For example, the statue can wave and turn its head back and forth robotically, or dance around in a circle within its space. You can start or stop the animation by tapping the statue twice in rapid succession (no action required).
  Up to three statues can be animated at a time in this way. When a fourth statue is completed, the first one ceases to move and loses its magic. Destroying a statue ends the effect.

### Redsmith Crucible Set
*(Wondrous Item, Common)*
- **Properties**:
  - This set of magic smith's tools includes a stone crucible that's been enchanted with minor transmutation magic and can be used in place of a set of [Smith's Tools](dm/items.md#smiths-tools) and as if you were proficient with it.
  - If you were already proficient with [Smith's Tools](dm/items.md#smiths-tools) or are a Dwarf, you can use an action to speak the tools' command word and do one of the following:
    - lower a **nonmagical** weapon made of metal into the crucible and hold it there for 10 minutes. At the end of that time, make a DC 10 STR Check using the smith's tools. On a success, the weapon is magically reforged. A reforged weapon counts as magical, and when you pull the reforged weapon from the crucible, you can change it into another type of weapon that shares the same properties as the original one. For example, a Light Hammer could become a Handaxe, or a Longsword could become a Warhammer. These benefits lasts until the next Long Rest, at which point the weapon becomes nonmagical once more and returns to its original form. *(Once per Long Rest)*
    - lower a **magical** weapon made of metal into the crucible and hold it there for 10 minutes. At the end of that time, make a DC 10 STR Check using the smith's tools. On a success, the weapon is **permanently** magically reforged, keeping all of its other properties. This counts as weapon modifier. On a failure, the weapon loses all of its magical properties. Either way, the Redsmith Crucible Set loses all of its magical properties after using it this way.
