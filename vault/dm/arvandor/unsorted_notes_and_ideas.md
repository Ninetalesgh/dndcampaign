Ruled by a trade profiteer with enough thugs on their payroll. (Antagonist Name: TODO, Right hand Name: TODO, Three named Persons of interest: TODO )
River is bridged up to the mountainpass for carts with an elevator, charging a fee for passage.


The lands above are 'cursed', that's why travellers are encouraged to pray at (TODO TOKEN OF PRAYER) 
for good fortune when travelling the mountain pass.
There is a prayer tree with a garden to keep evil at bay at the end of the bridge kept by the local priestess (Name: TODO, Deity: Chauntea, The Great Mother)

The riverwater is cursed and undrinkable, only the well in the center is drinkable because of the priestess' blessing. 
The priestess tends to all the gardens and keeps them healthy (ordinarily and magically healthy).
The garden tree after the bridge is a lucky charm for travellers. 

In the temple there is books on what happened to the ruins and the estate.

    She developed a 
     and feeds her cruel passions more and more, 
    ending up entering a pact with a demon and regularly offering blood sacrifice in her torture chambers.
    She is very educated about the town's history, and lets her mercenaries make use of the old 
    smuggler's tunnels to extract victims from the town. 
    She is aware of the kobolds. They in turn fear her and let her do her things in the tunnels.
    She respects highborn dwarves, as she takes them as noble people who once were great allies.
    Neither of them care much about the priestess, they like what she does. To her, she's a commoner. 
    To him, she's just another religious person that has her use but that's about it.
