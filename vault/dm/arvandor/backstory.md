#### Beginning ~ 600 DR
  First Settling by humans and dwarves in the Stormhorns between Tyrluk and High Horn establishing Elvine's Crossing north of the river 
    and the mining settlement Mithdral south of the river.
  the humans of Elvine's Crossing and the dwarves of Mithdral are flourishing in harmony with trade and craft.
  Both young settlements, they are ruled by houses Elster and Vinea above ground, and house Ironwhisper below.
  In reality the two human houses are one town council, with the men being called "Elster" and the women being called "Vinea".
  There always are to be 11 Elsters and 11 Vineas, all relevant town decisions are made by this council.
  Whenever a child of an Elster or Vinea turns 17 years old and there are fewer than 11 Elsters or Vineas, they get named accordingly and join the council.
  Or they can choose which name they want, if they are what's called "Feathered Vine", deemed to be the wisest leaders. (such as Lior Vinea)

  They decide to not introduce any new members to The Council and initiate a yearly remembrance day to remember "the noble House Vinea", 
    every year at sundawn of the shortest day.
  The Ruins are explored briefly but considered a lost cause and become a place to respect the dead and remember The Collapse.
  In the years after The Collapse people start to resettle south of the river, on top of Mithdral.
#### Founding of New Arvandal ~ 940 DR

  Zephyr sees this as an opportunity to ensure his son's reign and makes his wife Avery 
    take the name Elster to mark the onset of a traditional Patriarchy.

    named The Stockpile. 
#### Beginning of Resettlement of Mithdral ~ 1010 DR
  With The Academy Elevator granting access people from the surface begin to restaurate and resettle upper Mithdral. 
  However, class divide deepens over the coming centuries, people in Mithdral and people in New Arvandal develop in parallel and less together.

// GAP IN HISTORY
#### Maybe was a save haven during The Goblin Wars ~ 1374 DR



#### The Pollution ~ 1497 DR
  Lingering effects of The Selera Ritual and The Blood Curse cause 
    an earthquake that shakes some underground passageways loose.
  Necromantic magic now seeps into the riverwater and radiates upstream, giving it a slight foul stench 
    and making it undrinkable.
  Life for people in The Pit begins to deteriorate at a significantly faster pace. 
#### Death of Faelan Elster ~ 1499 DR
  Count Faelan passes away and reign of New Arvandal passes on to his son Dain,
  Displeased with the workings of the merchants and the tollkeeper Walt Ashbrook, 
  Dain decides to take charge himself and relieves the tollkeeper of his duties.  
  Since Walt Ashbrook was also the caretaker of Waukeen's Chapel, 
    it is now no longer frequented apart from superficial cleaning of the main room and balcony by The Priestess.
  While Faelan respected the deities and cared about traditions and rites such as honoring the tragedy of The House Vinea, 
    Dain actively neglects such "irrelevancies" and instead focuses on more populist festivities such as fighting events.   
#### Death of Lyanna Harvestsong ~ 1502 DR
  The Priestess' daugther Lyanna falls while exploring into the 
  tower in the ruins, breaks her leg and cracks her skull.
#### Introduction of Arcane Studies ~ 1504 DR

    the Stonelands moving south through the mountains trying to reach Cormyr.

    since moving through the east past Castle Crag proves too difficult.
#### Today ~ 1507 DR
