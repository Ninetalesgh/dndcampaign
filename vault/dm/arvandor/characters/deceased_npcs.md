#### Tazlyn Stonewright
Dwarf, F. (b. 681 DR - d. 930 DR) 
  Her Sarcophagus found in The Crypt (South Antechamber), it reads:
  "Tazlyn Stonewright
  Master Architect of Stone and Spirit
  Her hands shaped halls for dwarves and humans,
  Her vision carved the future in granite and stone.
  Born: 681 DR — Died: 930 DR
  A legacy built in stone, spanning cultures,
  Her walls still stand, and her name still echoes,
  From the great estates of men to the deepest halls of dwarven kind.
  Rest now in the halls you built, Tazlyn, for your work endures— eternal."
  She is buried with:
  - silver (20) gold (70), Thalioel's Tear, a warm orange translucent tear shaped amulet that grants resistance to cold and necrotic damage (Attunement).
  She built plenty of structures in Mithdral, The Crypt to contain The Blood Curse of the elves, The Mountain Pass, and The Two Estates.
###### Her Notes
Found among Brennar's old books:
  - About her husband Durnin Ironfoot: 
    How much they trusted each other.
    How painful it was to lose him and everyone else to The Frozen Depths.
  - About her friendship with the Elf Thalioel:
    How prosperous their exchanges are and how they shared so much passion for crafting and shaping the world around them.
    How painful it was to lose a dear friend and how immense Thalioel's and her companions' sacrifice was to Arvandral.
    the last tear Thalioel shed before The Blood Curse and the necklace she formed from it, a warm orange translucent tear shaped amulet.
  - About The Frozen Depths:
    the fear and panic.
    the destruction of Mithdral by Glacirax, losing home, friend, family.
    "I remember Thalioel's eyes, the thought of witnessing the loss of another home must have been unbearable for her."
  - About her son Balin:
    Balin chooses to be named Stonewright instead of Ironfoot and Tazlyn understands.
    How proud she is of him and what great work he will accomplish in our line of work. 
  - About House Elster and House Vinea:
    How she feels ever since The Frozen Depths, every generation of House Elster treats her worse than the previous, 
    and that after she built The Estates this became worse even faster.
    "I'm so glad Thedran, the foul bastard, died before me.
     I hope House Elster get their heads out of their unbearable behinds after my passing, 
     but I won't hold my breath, Thedran's son Zephyr stinks just as much with his juvenile nonsense."
  - About Selera Vinea:
    How her friendship withered and how she disproves of Selera's thirst for power 
    and warning her about the dangers of her persuit, even though she understands her frustration with House Elster.

  - About the creation of The Crypt:
    The Council wanted a simple chamber each for their Elster and Vinea.
    South Antechamber accessible from the graveyard so people could visit the recently deceased before they were carried further down into The Crypt.
  - About the Containment Engine:
    the containment of The Blood Curse and Thalioel's details about their corrupted souls, the restlessness they will feel, 
    that they won't be able to leave the mortal realm and the necessity to stop the soul corruption from festering.  
    the stronger the elf's magic, the stronger the containment would need to be to halt the festering, 
    therefore the lower chambers are reserved for The Sword Dancers and The Magi.
    Runic generator and capacitors to channel the magic nullification, 
    carving of elegant elven like patterns between geometric precise dwarven runes of abjuration
    drawing power from the ley lines and channeling them through pipes of Mithril to reach the tombs.
#### I.b. Durnin Ironfoot
Dwarf, M. (b. 684 DR - d. 859 DR )
  Tazlyn's husband who dies during The Frozen Depths.

Dwarf, M. (b. 1220 DR - d. 1485 DR)
  Shifted family focus to artisan crafts and fine carving.
### Selera Vinea
Human, F. (b. 876 DR - d. 935 DR)
She was the Necromancer who sought for power to permanently cleanse The Blood Curse.
Her notes found in The Red Estate's basement:
- About House Elster:
  How they repeatedly called for votes to reduce the number of Vineas in The Council and placed them at times were Vineas were absent to strategically bias the vote.
  How Sylric and Balen must have been murdered, they spoke out against this nonsense and voted sensibly, 
    House Elster otherwise stopped seeing The Council as a sensible body of leadership, they just uniformly opposed any proposition coming from a Vinea.
  How the construction of The Estates was a mistake, the separation of The Council must have drained every last sensible thought from House Elster.
  How Zephyr Elster was pushed into The Council by his father Thedran Elster, instead of Elinna Vinea's son Maron. 
    Maron was such a kind but fierce young man, he would have made a desperately needed change of course for House Elster.    
- About The Selera Ritual:
  > [!TODO]
- About The Blood Curse:
  How the ritual could drain power from the contained cursed souls for fuel. 
- About Tazlyn:
  How kind of a teacher she was.
  How her concern is understandable, but short sighted. 
  "I am aware the power I pursue comes with risk, but the gain could be much greater. Protecting Arvandral must be worth it."   
### Halric Varron
Human, M. (b. 891 DR - d. 935 DR)
He was captain of The Guard just before The Collapse, 
  he got murdered by Selera Vinea while he was investigating her secret necromancy.
His Sarcophagus is found in The Crypt (South Antechamber), it reads:
  "In the face of darkness, he stood unyielding,
  A heart of courage, a shield for the people.
  Captain Halric Varron
  Born: 891 DR — Died: 935 DR
  Though the mysteries of the night elude us,
  His resolve to protect never faltered.
  May his watch now end, his spirit at peace."
He is buried with:
- magical sword with minor bonuses against undead. (i.e. longsword with advantage against undead)
- silver (40) gold (30), a gold ring (worth 50)
His notes found in The Blue Estate archive: 
- About The Rise of the Undead:
  Halric begins to investigate grave robbing activities in 929 DR, "My first act as Captain of the guard is to put an end to these unholy acts!".
  He mentions documented cases of graves of grave robbery dating back to 911 DR, 
    which is shortly after The Estates were built.
  the vanishing corpses increase in numbers over time. 
  There is an increasing frequency of people going missing beginning around 930 DR. 
  It becomes more and more plausible that abductees are brought to The Red Estate.
  the first documented sightings of undead begin around 932 DR, 
    while most people don't want to believe it, Halric writes about going
    out at night, "We need to catch the act, or witness the unholy with my own eyes, Lathander give us courage."
  He mentions catching and slaying grave robbers twice, 
    and they followed an abduction that lead them to a tunnel entrance 
    before losing sight of them. "This tunnel must lead to The Red Estate, going in is too dangerous without Elster approval." 
  He writes about armaments against the darkness. 
    "After coming face to face with the walking dead I decided I must arm myself for the next encounter." 
### Lior Vinea
Human, +. (b. 852 DR - d. 933 DR)
Lior was the Councillor whose initiative led to the construction of The Mountain Pass.
Lior was a well liked diplomat and stood out because House Elster traditionally were the Diplomats and Merchants,
House Vinea were traditionally Scholars and Engineers. 
Lior's Sarcophagus is found in The Crypt (South Antechamber), it reads:
  "In every handshake, a promise; in every journey, a tale.
  Lior Vinea
  Merchant of Fortune, Friend of All Lands
  852 DR — 933 DR
  A visionary diplomat who proved that tradition is but a guide, not a chain.
  Our Feathered Vine Lior brought the world closer and wove unity where none had been.
  May Lior's steps echo eternally among the stars."
Lior is buried with:
- ring that gives proficiency in Persuasion. (Attunement)
- silver (30) gold (50), two rings with ornate designs (worth 120 and 80)

  She was the lost daughter of The Priestess Alenna, 
  her skeleton is found in the overground tower in The Ruins.
  ==MEDICINE== Broken leg and fractured skull, likely from falling. She was probably unable to climb back out.  
### Glacirax
Adult White Dragon, M. (b. 202 DR - d. 859 DR)
  His lair is deep underground with an opening down into The Underdark, which were his hunting grounds.
  The mine the dwarves dug for Mithril got too far into his lair and caused events of The Frozen Depths.
  He dies in a fierce battle, freezing nigh everyone in Mithdral to death and laying waste to the city.
  Feeling overpowered by The Blood Curse, he attempts to retreat.
  His wild flayling collapsing structures and shafts until he succumbs to his injuries. 
  Through the destruction the lair and his corpse are practically inaccessible without an extensive mining operation.
  His soul, having been touched by The Blood Curse might still linger, however.
