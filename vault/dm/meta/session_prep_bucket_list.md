## TODO


- NPC characters with pictures on the github
- add heroic inspiration and skills to the rules
- in play, force characters to introduce themselves to others

- mufi and kal relation, how much do they know of each other already? does mufi expect scorpion talking? 



## The Thief

- **Berric Morgrim.** Missing tooth, patchy beard. (jittering hand)

thief threatens XYZ and then rushes to sewer entrance

[TODO] maybe this is not a great scene now




# Secrets


> Kazimir knows Berric's jittering hand symptoms as likely caused by Black Lotus, which.. well, refining it makes money.
