## Playing 
I will attempt to introduce several game aspects, and then we see what we like. (Social Interaction, Exploration, Action)
I like presenting a tense experience in a gritty world. Comedy or humor naturally emerges from interactions, I feel. Obviously you as players can be as dorky or comedic as you like, and there will be dorky non-player-characters (NPCs) or encounters that I present more light hearted, but in general the world would have a serious tone. I'm super happy to try out anything though, please let me know what you would like to experience!

I will play scenes out with your characters sometimes, to show what kind of game flow or descriptions you can come up with yourselves (also because I enjoy it), I hope I won't represent your characters in ways you really dislike. Please let me know what you like / dislike whenever it comes up.

My creative freedom with your characters backstories? I will assume a lot of freedom, but if you can think of something at any point that bothers or would bother you, let me know please! For example if you really like this backstory person of your character and would dislike it if they turn out to be an antagonist.

It is okay to not find the right in-character words for a moment! Also please forgive me if I don't sometimes.

Ask me anything about the environment your characters are in or what they experience at any time!

Especially level 1 and 2 are "tutorial" like. To get to know the character, DnD in general, etc. They're not going to be dangerous.

Our content boundaries? This is meant as a safe space in which you feel powerful and have the ability to experiment and explore character traits you would like to project out. 
This refers to both off-screen and on-screen, from my side:
- Keep Player vs Player interaction consensual. You guys can tell me in private if you're okay with other players hurting (or mind controlling or whatever) your character, and I will forward it to players I deem appropriate. Or you communicate it directly between each other. Either way, get consent before you do something bad to other players' characters! 
- We will exclude any non-consensual sexual acts on- and off-screen.
- Otherwise, you can be mean, violent, devious, berating, flirty, or even polite to any of the NPCs I play.


## Organizing
Frequency of play? Attempting weekly would be the most fluent. Too infrequent will be a very different experience and break immersion significantly.

Missing sessions? Missing sessions every now and then should be okay, depending on what's currently going on in-world. but it's always possible to have your character fade into the background for a session.  

Your session note taking and post-session summarization? Will help all of us stay on the same page and it's nice to have to review. I'll be taking my own notes, but seeing it written down what you recall, noticed, and cared about in a session would help me a lot. This can be either one, a couple, or all players.

I bring tokens to help players with remembering game rules and keep track of what's going on.

Character sheets? You should all have a character sheet, either digital or physical. 

There will be rough in-game time progression throughout the day (unlike in Baldur's Gate), but do we limit rests to 2 Short Rests between Long Rests? 

Displaying order of Initiative? I haven't really thought of a good way of doing that yet, any ideas welcome for when we get there. (Cards? Just a whiteboard visible for everyone might work too!) could a player always do this instead of me?

Do we want to play with Ammo? We have noone that will use ammo naturally all the time, so this would allow "specific arrows, bolts, or darts" to be more special and stand out for the occasional shot.

Do we want a rules lawyer player on standby? If there's a rules misunderstanding that player has the rules ready and I can focus on other things in the meanwhile. Most of the time I don't think it'll be needed, but sometimes double checking what a spell or effect does doesn't hurt.

Last but very important: Again, please let me know if something is not fun I will do my best to improve or change play to fit all the players' desires. 
If you are disinterested entirely or want to step out for other reasons, please also communicate that directly \<3.
This is supposed to be a fun time together, not just a scheduled duty on your calendar.
