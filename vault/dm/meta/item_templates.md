webgrip rucksack - This spider leather bag is lined with a thin layer of adhesive web. 
Items stored inside the bag are held in place by the web, 
preventing stored items from clattering around or being removed without permission. 
While you're wearing the bag, creatures other than you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks 
to steal from the bag.   The bag and its eight straps adhere to the surface they're pressed against, 
such as a creature's torso or the wall of an inn. If you're wearing the bag, 
you can gently remove the straps from your body as an action. Other creatures that attempt 
to wrench the bag from you make any Strength checks to do so with disadvantage. 
The bag can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds. Spider leather is pliable and stretches easily, 
allowing the bag to shrink and grow to accommodate the objects placed inside to some degree.  
 Even though the eyes adorning the bag are lifeless and unmoving, they still blink on rare occasion.
