Player character questions:
  What is something your character regrets from their youth?
  Give me a sentence or two of backstory.

player note taking! 

TTRPG gives you a safe space to explore characters 
and behaving that you project out.

it is okay to not find the right in-character words for a moment.

Brennan Lee Mulligan: Characters are not opaque, they are stained glass and you, 
the player is the light that shines through.


Table preparation:

  Distances are measured in squares, lets just display them without unit ( 30 ft => 6 ).
  We can then choose whether we want diagonal movement to be 2/3 or something.


  TODO Special action cards + Weapon actions (like BG3), 
    Green for Actions, Orange for Bonus Actions.
    
  TODO Tokens for Action (Green), Bonus Action (Orange), Reaction (Purple)

  TODO Monster cards? 

  TODO cards for characters and monsters for order of initiative


Table manners:
  Romancing NPCs is okay.
  Leave out sexuality that isn't explicitly consensual.
  How gory?
  Special fears to be gentle with, spiders, snakes, drowning?
  Ask me about the environment your characters are in whenever you feel like it.



Rules:
  There will be time progression, but rests are limited to 2 Short Rests (SR) between Long Rests (LR).

  Magic items are noticably magical when you handle them.
  One item can be identified per SR.
  A maximum of 3 attunements total.
  One item can be attuned per SR.
  One item can be unattuned per SR.

  Ammo or not?

###### Warlock:
When spellcasting -> You feel the warmth of this devilish breath flow through you and you feel how this power from hell washes together with your celestial spark like a boiling drop of red ink in clear water.
