# Basic Rules
## Ability Scores
- **Strength (STR).** Physical might; Lift, push, pull, or break something; Physically resist direct force.
  - **Athletics.** Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:
    - *You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.*
    - *You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.*
    - *You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.*
  - *Other Strength Checks:*
    - *Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door.*
    - *Break free of bonds.*
    - *Push through a tunnel that is too small.*
    - *Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it.*
    - *Tip over a statue.*
    - *Keep a boulder from rolling.*
  - *Carrying Capacity.* Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 7.5. This is the weight in kg that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.
  - *Push, Drag, or Lift.* You can push, drag, or lift a weight in kg up to twice your carrying capacity (or 15 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 1 *(1.5m)*.
  - *Size and Strength.* Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each [Size](game_rules.md#advanced-rules#creature-sizes) category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.
  - **Strength Attack Rolls and Damage.** You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

- **Dexterity (DEX).** Agility, reflexes, and balance; Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly; Dodge out of harm's way.
Acrobatics
  - **Acrobatics.** Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.
  - **Sleight of Hand.** Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.
  - **Stealth.** Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.
    - *Hiding.* The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.
    You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.
    In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.
    **Passive Perception.** When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.
  - *Other Dexterity Checks:*
    - *Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent.*
    - *Steer a chariot around a tight turn.*
    - *Pick a lock.*
    - *Disable a trap.*
    - *Securely tie up a prisoner.*
    - *Wriggle free of bonds.*
    - *Play a stringed instrument.*
    - *Craft a small or detailed object.*
  - *Armor Class.* Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.
  - *Initiative.* At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a DEX check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat.
  - **Dexterity Attack Rolls and Damage.** You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.

- **Costitution (CON).** Health and stamina; Push your body beyond normal limits; Endure a toxic hazard.
  - *Constitution Checks:*
    - *Hold your breath.*
    - *March or labor for hours without rest.*
    - *Go without sleep.*
    - *Survive without food or water.*
    - *Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go.*
  - **Hit Points.** Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points (or you take the average value instead of rolling).

- **Intelligence (INT).** Reasoning and memory; Reason or remember; Recognize an illusion as fake.
  - **Arcana.** Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.
  - **History.** Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.
  - **Investigation.** When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.
  - **Nature.** Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.
  - **Religion.** Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.
  - *Other Intelligence Checks:*
    - *Communicate with a creature without using words.*
    - *Estimate the value of a precious item.*
    - *Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard.*
    - *Forge a document.*
    - *Recall lore about a craft or trade.*
    - *Win a game of skill.*
  - **Spellcasting Ability.** Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.

- **Wisdom (WIS).** Perceptiveness and mental fortitude; Notice things in the environment or in creatures' behaviour; Resist a mental assault.
  - **Animal Handling.** When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal's intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.
  - **Insight.** Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.
  - **Medicine.** A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.
  - **Perception.** Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.
    - ***FINDING A HIDDEN OBJECT***
    When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.
    In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.
  - **Survival.** The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.
  - *Other Wisdom Checks:*
    - *Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow.*
    - *Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead.*
  - **Spellcasting Ability.** Clerics, Druids, and Rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.

- **Charisma (CHA).** Confidence, poise, and charm; Influence, entertain, or deceive; Assert your identity.
  - **Deception.** Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.
  - **Intimidation.** When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.
  - **Performance.** Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.
  - **Persuasion.** When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.
  - *Other Charisma Checks:*
    - *Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip.*
    - *Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation.*
  - **Spellcasting Ability.** Bards, Paladins, Sorcerers, and Warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.

>[!INFO] Whenever Abilities are mentioned in game we refer to the Modifier, not the score itself! The Modifier is always *(AbilityScore-10)/2* rounded down. For example, an Ability Score of 8 or 9 would result in -1, whereas an Ability Score of 14 or 15 would result in +2.

- **Proficiency Bonus (PB)** -> +2 on all tests you are proficient in, this will increase after level 4. This bonus does not stack, multiple proficiencies in the same skill don't give you +4, etc.  
- **Three Types of d20 Tests** -> Attack Roll, Ability Check, Saving Throw
  - ***Attack Roll*** -> STR for melee, DEX for ranged, Varies for Spell Attack. Add your Proficiency Bonus if it's with a weapon you're proficient with or always add it if it's a Spell Attack. When you roll equal to or higher than your target's AC, you hit and roll the damage you do!
  - ***Ability Check*** -> Either roll on an Ability directly or on a Skill (Athletics, Acrobatics, etc.). Add your Proficiency Bonus to Ability Checks you are proficient in. 
    - ***Tools*** -> Proficiency stacks with Skills when Tools are used, if you have Proficiency in both the Skill and the Tool for an associated check you roll with Advantage.
  - ***Saving Throw*** -> Add your Proficiency Bonus if you're proficient in the Saving Throw of the Ability in question. I'll shorthand this to "Saves" in most places.
- **Advantage & Disadvantage** -> Roll twice on d20 Tests, with Advantage you take the higher roll of the two, with Disadvantage you take the lower. Advantage and Disadvantage cancel each other out and never stack (for example, 3 sources of Advantage and 1 source of Disadvantage result in a normal roll).
- **Difficulty Class (DC)** -> Very easy 5, easy 10, medium 15, hard 20, Very hard 25, nearly impossible 30 
- **Armor Class (AC)** -> Your Base AC + DEX. You can only have one Base AC, by default that is 10.
- **Health Points (HP)** -> Your Health, when it drops to 0 you are on the brink of death! You can never have more HP than your HP maximum.
- **Long Rest (LR)** -> 8 Hours of rest (of which ~6 are sleep) to regain all your HP and Spell Slots and everything else that regenerates or refreshes after Long Rests. All effects lasting until the next Long Rest end. *(If you forego Long Rests these effects instead last a maximum of 24 hours)*
- **Hit Point Dice** -> Type of dice that represents how tough you are depending on your class. You have an amount of HP Dice equal to your Level. You regenerate *[Level / 2] (round up)* HP Dice after a Long Rest. 
- **Short Rest (SR)** -> 1 Hour of rest. Spend and roll as many HP Dice as you want to regenerate HP, add your CON modifier to each die. Some resources regenerate after Short Rests.

## Turn Based Play
While we're not playing Turn Based do what you want, ask the GM anything, role play ahead!
We play Turn Based in dangerous time sensitive situations like Combat. When we do, we use Initiative.

- Each **Round** of Initiative lets everyone (Players, NPCs and Monsters) take their turn once! Each Round takes roughly 6 seconds, which makes 1 minute = 10 Rounds. 
- We use a custom distance unit in game, it's just a unitless value and 1 unit is the size of one real world miniature square and equals *~1.5m* in the fantasy world. I'll always have both this unit and meters listed in rules. On table play one Inch (or one square on miniature terrain with a grid) equals 1 unit. When looking up online content which is displayed in *feet*, divide that value by 5 to get to our unitless value (for example 30 feet = 6).

The Round: 
> Roll Initiative at the beginning *(Are you Surprised or Hidden?)*
> Each Round is rougly 6 seconds.
> During each round everyone gets 1 Turn.

- **Roll Initiative** -> Roll a d20 + DEX, if you are Surprised you have Disadvantage on this roll, if you are [Invisible](conditions.md#invisible) (or Hidden) you have Advantage instead.

What you can do when we play Turn Based:

> **1 Movement!**
> **1 Action (A)** -> Your main thing!
> **1 Bonus Action (BA)** -> Hastily drink a potion? Also some Spells or Feats are Bonus Actions. 
> **1 Reaction (R)** -> Readied Action Trigger or Opportunity Attack?
> **1 Free Action** -> Something very minor, like open a door or push a button.
> **1 Shout something!**

- **Movement**: Move - up to a range equal to your Speed. You can do this in parts (for example, move 1, use Action, move 4, use Bonus Action, move 1).
  - Move slower through Difficult Terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples. 
  - You can also fall Prone at will, of course.
  - *ON GRIDS ONLY*: Diagonal movement costs 3/2, rounding down the total (so 2 full diagonal "steps" cost 3) 

### Default Actions
#### Attack
Choose a target in range and roll for attack! Roll a d20 and add your Attack Modifier.
If you roll a 20 on an attack roll before modifiers you score a ***Critical Hit***, which lets you roll double the number of damage *dice* (for example, if you would deal 1d6+4 damage, you deal 2d6+4 damage instead).
  - **Melee Attack**: Attack something within reach, unless otherwise specified, your Melee Attack reach is 1 (so you can attack things directly next to you). Your Attack Modifier for Melee Attacks is your STR + your PB, if you're proficient with the weapon you're attacking with.
  - **Ranged Attack**: Attack something in range of your Ranged Attack. If the target is within range 1 or above normal range, you attack with Disadvantage. Your Attack Modifier for Ranged Attacks is your DEX + your PB, if you're proficient with the weapon you're attacking with.
  - **Ranged or Melee Spell Attack**: Attack something in range of your Spell Attack, with the same restrictions other Melee or Ranged attacks would have respectively. Your Attack Modifier for Spell Attacks is your Spellcasting Ability (INT/WIS/CHA) + your PB. *(For example, if your PB is +2 and your WIS is +3 as a Druid, you would have a +5 Spell Attack Modifier)*
![\|30](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/c/ca/Main_Hand_Attack_Icon.webp)

#### Dash
Gain additional Movement equal to your *modified* Speed for this turn. *For example, if your base speed is 6 and your speed is reduced by 2 by some effect, your Dash Action would grant you another 4 speed for this turn.*
![\|30](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/8/8e/Dash_bonus_action_Icon.webp)

#### Disengage
Your movement doesn't provoke [Opportunity Attacks](game_rules.md#opportunity-attack) and you gain 1 *(1.5m)* extra Movement for the rest of this turn. You can't use this if your Speed is 0.
![\|30](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/4/4b/Disengage_Bonus_Action_Icon.webp)

#### Dodge
Until the start of your next turn, attacks against you have Disadvantage and you get Advantage on DEX Saves.
![\|30](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/4/4d/Uncanny_Dodge_Icon.webp)

#### Hide
Make a DC 15 DEX (Stealth) Check to try to conceal yourself, while you're [Heavily Obscured](game_rules.md#heavily-obscured) or behind at least [Three-Quarters Cover](game_rules.md#cover) and out of any other enemy's line of sight. On a successful check you are mechanically [Invisible](conditions.md#invisible). Make note of your stealth check's total score, that is the DC for your enemy to find you without directly walking into line of sight. 
The condition ends on you immediately after any of the following occurs: 
  - you make a sound louder than a whisper.
  - an enemy finds you.
  - you make an Attack Roll.
  - you cast a Spell with a Verbal component.
![\|30](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/e/ec/Hide_Bonus_Action_Icon.webp)

#### Ready Action
Prepare to take your Action outside of your turn as [Reaction](game_rules.md#turn-based-play#trigger-readied-action) to a trigger you define (for example "I hide behind the door and will attack the first enemy that runs in").

When you Ready a spell, you cast it as normal (expending any resources used to cast it) but hold its energy, which you release with your Reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of an Action, and holding on to the spell's magic requires [Concentration](conditions.md#concentration), which you can maintain up to the start of your next turn. If your [Concentration](conditions.md#concentration) is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect.
![\|30](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/e/e1/Magical_Ambush_Icon.webp)

#### Help
When you take the Help action, you do one of the following:
- **Assist an Ability Check.** Choose one of your skill or tool proficiencies and one ally who is near enough for you to assist verbally or physically when they make an Ability check. That ally has Advantage on the next Ability check they make with the chosen skill or tool. This benefit expires if the ally doesn't use it before the start of your next turn. The DM has final say on whether your assistance is possible.
- **Assist an Attack Roll.** You momentarily distract an enemy within range 1 *(1.5m)* of you, giving Advantage to the next attack roll by one of your allies against that enemy. This benefit expires at the start of your next turn.
![\|30](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/d/dc/Fast_Hands_Icon.webp)

#### Influence, Search, Study, Utilize, or Stabilize
Do something in the heat of the moment, whatever you try might be accomplished right away or at least get you on the right track!
  - **Influence a creature**, like talk them down, distract them, or alter their attitude some other way. (Usually CHA)
  - **Try to find something**, like the source of some poison gas, the hidden switch on the wall to open the secret door, etc. (Usually WIS)
  - **Study something**, like a spell that an evildoer cast, find out where interleaved mechanical switches lead to understand what would happen if you flipped some switch, or how tree roots are growing towards a source of some energy. (Usually INT)
  - **Versatile**: Use, or do something with, some object, whatever it might be.
  - Attempt to **stabilize** another character on the brink of death, at 0 HP, with a WIS (Medicine) Check. 
![\|30](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/b/bd/Generic_Tactical_Icon.webp)
  
### Default Reactions

#### Opportunity Attack
Melee Attack someone who is about to move out of your Melee Reach (not if they're pushed or otherwise physically moved by force).
![\|30](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/3/35/Opportunity_Attack_Icon.webp)

#### Trigger Readied Action
Trigger an Action you previously [Readied](game_rules.md#ready-action).
![\|30](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/8/86/Generic_Threat_Icon.webp)

# Advanced Rules

- **Temporary HP (THP)** -> Extra health that allows you to go above your HP max, usually from some invigorating or morale boosting effect. You can only ever have one THP pool and they don't stack (for example, if you have 6 THP and would gain 10 THP from some effect, your THP becomes the higher one, in this case 10). THP are not healing.
- **Death Saves & Death** -> When you hit 0 HP you are [Unconscious](conditions.md#unconscious).

## Damage Types
- ![\|25](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/7/7d/Bludgeoning_Damage_Icon.png) **Bludgeoning** -> Bonk.
- ![\|25](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/0/0b/Piercing_Damage_Icon.png) **Piercing** -> Acupuncture.
- ![\|25](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/f/f0/Slashing_Damage_Icon.png) **Slashing** -> Cut things.
- ![\|25](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/0/05/Cold_Damage_Icon.png) **Cold** -> Very icy.
- ![\|25](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/8/84/Fire_Damage_Icon.png) **Fire** -> Hottie.
- ![\|25](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/3/31/Lightning_Damage_Icon.png) **Lightning** -> That's shocking.
- ![\|25](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/8/87/Thunder_Damage_Icon.png) **Thunder** -> VERY LOUD THINGS.
- ![\|25](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/5/5f/Acid_Damage_Icon.png) **Acid** -> Alien blood and chemicals.
- ![\|25](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/5/55/Poison_Damage_Icon.png) **Poison** -> McDonalds.
- ![\|25](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/7/78/Radiant_Damage_Icon.png) **Radiant** -> Holy fire and sun lasers.
- ![\|25](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/3/39/Necrotic_Damage_Icon.png) **Necrotic** -> Rot, death of flesh.
- ![\|25](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/d/d1/Force_Damage_Icon.png) **Force** -> Energy.
- ![\|25](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/0/04/Psychic_Damage_Icon.png) **Psychic** -> Brain Hurty.
### Resistance
Resistance to a damage type halves all damage of that type you take (round down).
### Vulnerability
Vulnerability to a damage type doubles all damage of that type you take.
### Immunity
Immunity to a damage type reduces all damage of that type to 0.

## Displacement
- **Being Pushed.** A pushed creature gets moved by the stated amount. If an obstacle is in the way, the creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 2 spaces *(3m)* pushing was prevented by the obstacle.
- **Falling.**
  - Controlled falling of 2 or less spaces always succeeds.
  - A falling creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 1 space *(1.5m)* of uncontrolled falling, to a maximum of 30d6, and lands [Prone](vault/conditions.md#prone), unless they control the fall and amount of uncontrolled falling is less than 3.
  - To control the fall a creature can make a **DEX (acrobatics)** check. For every 5 points rolled above 10 the creature may count the fall as having 1 fewer space. *(optional for the sake of attacking while falling)*
  - **Falling Attack.** A creature can attempt a **Melee Attack Action** against another creature or object below it. If the attack misses, the attacker takes all accumulated damage dice as if it was a controlled fall. If the attack hits, the damage dice that would accumulate from the fall are split evenly between attacker and attacked, favoring the attacker. The attacker takes their own damage as usual, the attacked takes the damage as part of the attack's damage roll *(for the sake of Critical Hits)*.
  *(i.e. falling 5 spaces while attacking, the falling creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and adds 3d6 to the damage roll)*

## Mounted Combat

- During your move, you can mount a creature that is within range 1 *(1.5m)* of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your Speed (round down).
- **Controlling a Mount**
  - You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, mules, and similar creatures have such training.
  - The Initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves on your turn as you direct it, and it has only three action options during that turn: [Dash](vault/game_rules.md#dash), [Disengage](vault/game_rules.md#disengage), and [Dodge](vault/game_rules.md#dodge). A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.
    In contrast, an independent mount - one that lets you ride but ignores your control - retains its place in the Initiative order and moves and acts as it likes.
- **Falling Off**
  - If an effect is about to move your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 DEX Save or fall off, landing [Prone](vault/conditions.md#prone) in an unoccupied space within range 1 *(1.5m)* of the mount.
  - While mounted, you must make the same Save if you're knocked [Prone](vault/conditions.md#prone) or the mount is.

## Light and Visibility
### Bright Light
See normally. Even gloomy daus provide Bright Light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination with specific radius.
### Dim Light
Lightly Obscured area. Dim Light is usally a boundary between Bright Light and surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as Dim Light, so does for example a full moon.
- Lightly Obscured means Disadvantage on WIS (Perception) to see.
### Darkness
Heavily Obscured area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night, withing the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness.
- Attempting to see something Heavily Obscured is mechanically equivalent to being [Blinded](conditions.md#blinded).

### Lightly Obscured
Disadvantage on WIS (Perception) to see.
### Heavily Obscured
Attempting to see something Heavily Obscured is mechanically equivalent to being [Blind](conditions.md#blinded).

### Special senses
#### Blindsight
Within the stated range, you can see creatures that are not behind [Total Cover](game_rules.md#advanced-rules#cover), even if that creature is [Invisible](conditions.md#invisible) or you are [Blinded](conditions.md#blinded) or in [Darkness](game_rules.md#advanced-rules#darkness).

#### Darkvision
Within the stated range: 
  - You can see in [Dim Light](game_rules.md#advanced-rules#dim-light) as if it were [Bright Light](game_rules.md#advanced-rules#bright-light)
  - You can see in [Darkness](game_rules.md#advanced-rules#darkness) as if it were [Dim Light](game_rules.md#advanced-rules#dim-light), you discern colors in that darkness as shades of gray.
  
#### Tremorsense
Within the stated range, you can pinpoint the location of creatures and moving objects, if you and anything you are detecting are both in contact with the same surface (such as the ground, a wall, or a ceiling), or the same liquid.

#### Truesight
Within the stated range:
  - You can see in normal and magical [Darkness](game_rules.md#advanced-rules#darkness).
  - You can see [Invisible](conditions.md#invisible) creatures and objects.
  - You automatically succeed on Saves against visual illusions.
  - You can discern the true form of any creature or object you see that has been transformed by magic.
  - You can see into the Ethereal Plane.

### Cover
Draw lines from one corner of the your square to 4 corners of one of the squares of the creature you're attacking. If ANY line is obstructed, the target is partly obscured and gains benefits of at least Half Cover.

Cover | Benefit
:-- | :--
Half | +2 AC and DEX Saves
Three-Quarter | +5 AC and DEX Saves
Total | Can't be targeted directly

Example Cover:

## Sleep, Food, and Water Needs
- **Dehydration**: You need about 3 liters of fluid per day. If you consume less than half of that you gain 1 stack of [Exhaustion](conditions.md#exhaustion).
- **Malnutrition**: About 500g of food per day. If you consume less than half of that you must succeed on a DC 10 CON Save or gain 1 stack of [Exhaustion](conditions.md#exhaustion). Starting at day 5 you additionally gain 1 Exhaustion at the end of every day without Save. 
Exhaustion caused by Dehydration or Malnutrition **can't** be removed unless you consume a daily portion of fluid or food respectively.
[TODO] THESE RULES SEEM INCOMPLETE? 
- **Sleep Deprivation.** Whenever you end a 24-hour period without finishing a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 10 CON Save or gain 1 stack of [Exhaustion](conditions.md#exhaustion). Each consecutive 24-hour period increases the DC by 5.

## Long Rest Activity
