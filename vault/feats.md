# Origin Feats

## Alert
- **Initiative Proficiency.** When you roll Initiative, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to the roll.
- **Initiative Swap.** Immediately after you roll Initiative, you can swap your Initiative with the Initiative of one willing ally in the same combat. You can't make this swap if you or the ally is [Incapacitated](conditions.md#incapacitated).

# Class Feats
## Artificer

### The Right Tool for the Job
You've learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with [Thieves' Tools](vault/dm/items.md#thieves-tools) or any artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within range 1 *(1.5m)* of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.

### Steel Defender
Your tinkering has borne you a faithful companion, a [Steel Defender](vault/feats.md#steel-defender---summon).
It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. You determine the creature's appearance and whether it has two legs or four; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.
At the end of a long rest, you can create a new steel defender if you have your [Smith's Tools](vault/dm/items.md#smiths-tools) with you. If you already have a steel defender from this feature, the first one immediately perishes. The defender also perishes if you die.

- **Steel Defender in Combat.** In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the [Dodge](vault/game_rules.md#dodge) action unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Beast's Strike action. If you are [Incapacitated](vault/conditions.md#incapacitated), the beast acts on its own and isn't limited to the [Dodge](vault/game_rules.md#dodge) action.

- **Tinkerer's Pet.** If [Mending](vault/spells.md#mending) is cast on it, it regains 2d6 HP. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your [Smith's Tools](vault/dm/items.md#smiths-tools) as an **Action** to revive it, provided you are within range 1 *(1.5m)* of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The steel defender returns to life after 1 minute with full HP.
![\|50](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/0/03/Portrait_Bernard.png)

    *Hit:* 1d8 + PB force damage.
   - **Repair (3/Day)**. The magical mechanisms inside the defender restore 2d8 + PB HP to itself or to one construct or object within 1 *(1.5m)* of it.
- **Reactions**: 
   - **Deflect Attack**. The defender imposes disadvantage on the attack roll of one creature it can see that is within 1 *(1.5m)* of it, provided the attack roll is against a creature other than the defender.

As a **Magic Action**, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and choose a point within range 12 *(18m)*.

### Maneuver
#### Bait and Switch

When you're within range 1 *(1.5m)* of a creature on your turn, you can expend one Superiority Die and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 1 range movement and the creature is willing and isn't [Incapacitated](conditions.md#incapacitated). This movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks.
  - **Roll the Superiority Die.** Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a bonus to **AC** equal to the number rolled.
 ![\|50](https://imgur.com/URyXlFw.png)

![\|50](https://bg3.wiki/w/images/4/40/Unarmed_Strike_Icon.webp)

## Paladin
### Divine Sense
As a **Bonus Action**, you can open your awareness to detect **Celestials**, **Fiends**, and **Undead**. For the next 10 minutes or until you are [Incapacitated](conditions.md#incapacitated), you know the location of any creature of those types within range 12 *(18m)*  of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the [Hallow](spells.md#hallow) spell.

Immediately after you cast [Divine Smite](spells.md#spells-d#divine-smite), you can expend one use of your **Channel Divinity** and distribute Temporary HP to creatures of your choice within range 6 *(9m)* of yourself, which can include you.

## Ranger
### Primal Companion
You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with nature. Choose its stat block: Beast of the Land, [Beast of the Sea](vault/feats.md#beast-of-the-sea), or Beast of the Sky. You also determine the kind of animal it is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever beast you choose, it bears primal markings indicating its supernatural origin.
The beast is Friendly to you and your allies and obeys your commands. It vanishes if you die.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can summon a different primal beast, which appears in an unoccupied space within range 1 *(1.5m)* of you. You choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this feature, the old one vanishes when the new one appears.

It can move and use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the [Dodge](vault/game_rules.md#dodge) action unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Beast's Strike action.

### Wild Magic Surge
Once per turn, you can roll 1d20 immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot. If you roll a 20, roll a d100 on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect depending on the rolled result.

## Great Weapon Master - PHB 2014
You've learned to put the weight of a weapon to your advantage, letting its momentum empower your strikes. You gain the following benefits:
- On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.
- Before you make a melee attack with a heavy weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.

## Inspiring Leader
- **Bolstering Performance.** When you finish a Short or Long Rest, you can give an inspiring performance: a speech, song, or dance. When you do so, choose up to six allies (which can include yourself) within range 6 *(9m)*of yourself who witness the performance. The chosen creatures each gain Temporary HP equal to your character level plus the modifier of the ability you increased with this feat.

## Mounted Combatant
- **Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom by 1, to a maximum of 20.

- **Mounted Strike.** While [Mounted](vault/game_rules.md#mounted-combat), you have Advantage on attack rolls against any unmounted creature within range 1 *(1.5m)* of your mount that is at least one [size](vault/game_rules.md#creature-sizes) smaller than the mount.

- **Leap Aside.** If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a DEX Save to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the Save and only half damage if it fails. For your mount to gain this benefit, you must be riding it, and neither of you can be [Incapacitated](vault/conditions.md#incapacitated).

- **Veer.** While mounted, you can force an attack that hits your mount to hit you instead if you are not [Incapacitated](vault/conditions.md#incapacitated).

## Speedy
- **Speed Increase.** Your Speed increases by 2 *(3m)*.
- **Dash over Difficult Terrain.** When you take the [Dash](vault/game_rules.md#dash) action on your turn, Difficult Terrain doesn't cost you extra movement for the rest of that turn.
- **Agile Movement.** Opportunity Attacks have Disadvantage against you.

## Spell Sniper
- **Bypass Cover.** Your Spell Attacks ignore Half Cover and Three-Quarters Cover.
- **Casting in Melee.** Being within range 1 *(1.5m)* of an enemy doesn't impose Disadvantage on your Spell Attacks.
- **Increased Range.** Your **Spell Attacks** that have at least range 2 *(3m)* gain an additional 12 *(18m)* of range.
